Must be so hard on them.I still just can’t believe he’s goneanyone else think he was targeted?Zeynel ich fick deine Mutter1.5 months later and this headline is still so freaking surrealI still don’t believe it, so sadWho the fuck gave the award made me smileYou don’t have to like Kobe to respect his passion as both a amazing basketball player, and as a father .Kobe? .... Kobye ?... Kbye ?Obligatory, “well this blew up...”Still hurts. I can\\'t believe Kobe really is gone. Far too soon. And Gigi I can\\'t imagine what the family is still going throughI just want to know if the pilot was pressured to fly in conditions where all other helicopters in the area were grounded, maybe cause his clients were so high profile idkMy grandpa died in October, guess that\\'s fitting news material nowI hate to be morbid. But I’m just curious if anyone thinks they were identifiable after the incident. Makes me sick to imagine but I just really want to know.Enjoy your down-votes!Nice bru 👊 I’ve started following him on YouTube now. I’m interested to hopefully understand the pilot’s thought process in these circumstances and conditions. It seems he was trained as an instructor to use Instruments and had deep knowledge of the route he was flying. Why did he drop nearly 400 feet in 14 seconds? What was his plan B?[deleted]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Sgb37eRXCoHere’s a quick video showing the inside of the helicopter if anyone is interested.I’m seeing a video now that points out that the pilot may have been looking for the Sheriffs heli pad that was roughly 1 mile west right off 101 during those last seconds when he turned left like he did. Look at google maps and go directly left from the crash site and you will find it.  I can’t imagine what the victims loved ones are feeling right now.I\\'m still trying to wrap my head around all of this.... Is it not plausible for the pilot to just kinda hover in a stand still and not move anywhere until he got to grips with where he was at/ weather cleared over??? Or even just hovered to a higher altitude to where you KNOW there are no mountains/hills?? I don\\'t get why a pilot would want to move forward/back/to the side if he couldn\\'t see where he was at???Kobe’s cool and all, but i think the helicoptor pilot tried to do a kobe through the smoke, but kobes rarely work.I’m going to hellIt sucks more that it was most likely pilot error. Pilot\\'s dead so can\\'t do much about that. And apparently the bodies were not found intact which makes it more devastating to imagine. Missing arms...heads...ugh :\\'(Two days later and I\\'m still in denial. Thinking about the children he left behind just crushes me.  But at the same time it forces me to appreciate mine even more. You never know when it\\'s going to be your time so take nothing and no one for granted.Kobe was in a [trademark battle](https://theblast.com/c/kobe-bryant-pharma-company-black-mamba-supplements?utm_source=r_yahoo) with convicted drug smuggler Jared Wheat, the CEO of Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals.*Wheat once plotted to kill an FDA agent[“In 2004, Wheat and partners Stephen D. Smith and Tomasz Holda discussed assassinating a Food and Drug Administration agent who had been investigating Hi-Tech, according to the affidavit.” ](https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/shredded-wheat-article-1.209950) “Jared Wheat has been on the government’s radar for more than two decades. Twenty years ago, he was convicted as a drug smuggler who operated a massive marijuana ring in the South.

[“He was calling the shots for the whole thing and he was doing so in jail.”](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/04/for-ex-pot-kingpin-new-troublehealth-supplements.html)Why am I having a hard time with the helicopter tragedy? Everyone (even local toronto hockey leagues) are honoring Kobe Bryant\\'s death with 24 seconds off the clock etc. Like come on guys, there was 8 other lives taken here as well. Its just mixed feelings considering Kobe Bryant\\'s legal past, and now the whole NBA league is talking of retiring his number?!?Am I wrong here for thinking this?Something I was thinking about recently as the world recovers this is the psychology of tragedy. I feel affected by this and while I\\'m basketball and sports fan, I was never a Lakers or Kobe fan specifically. Not only am I sad about Kobe, I am sad for his daughter and the other families that are now broken because of this horrible accident. What is odd to me is why I was not affected nearly as much even though 10 times as many people were killed when Iran shot down Flight 752 just a few weeks ago. There really is something to be said about that quote, \"One death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic.\" It\\'s like the event is so too heavy to even register. This one though, this one registers and it hurts.Saw him play as i sat court side many times. What a freak talent man i feel bad for him. RIPWhat the fuck this is out of nowhereNot the same scenario of course, but this reminded me of Aaliyah and her crews\\' deaths.  What a start to 2020.[deleted]His wealth killed them all.Edit: We really do need a Speaker for the Dead.Yeah and that hot dog better be wrapped with melted cheese and ham and laced with mayoIt kills me, seeing some comments from people. About the Rape cases from 2003, I play a lot of games I go online and hang out but man hearing people say. \\'Oh he was a nasty human, and deserved it.\\' Just kills me on the inside. Yes, he was a rich man who was able to pay it off outside of court but the difference is. He has to live with that all his life. And always have that 1% of people who remind him of a mistake, the man died twice. Let him be stop ruining it for everyone. He literally did nothing but try to improve his image and do better. It\\'s disgusting, and some of the comments on how \\'rich rapist had daughter of him got whats coming.\\' That terrible, shame on people. It\\'s sad that I may or may not leave my Online MMO guild because of the words my Guildmaster said about this. Cause its disgusting, and anyone who thinks the same way. Please seek help, because life is to short to hold someones actions over him for life if he did it once. Second chances are there for a reason, sorry you have to be a living in the past and shit on someone.Every day you must have the realisation that you may die that day. And then nothing for eternity.[deleted]I wonder if Mrs. Bryant will sue TMZ for releasing the news before the family was notified? If so I would love to hear about it. How awful would someone feel learning about the passing of a loved one via TMZ.TMZ is gross anymore, there should be a news outlet that reports on TMZ and the employees the same as they do people, yes celebrities are people too.https://youtu.be/AweODjz1P74 Go and fuck him upThree victims have been recovered from crash site, including Kobe Bryant, according to the LA County coroner\\'s office.Does anyone know if they discovered the bodies? Each of them? How sad this is...Still thinking about it every few hours. Fuck helicopters we need to invent some sort of encompassing airbag for crashes, anything.Imagine being the maverick who put the Made Me Smile award here lmfaoCorrection, traveling at 184mph and descending at 4000 feet per minute.https://www.google.com/amp/s/wgntv.com/2020/01/27/victims-of-kobe-bryant-crash-identified-helicopter-flew-in-fog-that-grounded-other-choppers/amp/I read a report that the helicopter was traveling at 180mph but in a 45mph dive.  So maybe they did know.Or maybe it’s actually a deep joke that is so complex that you all missed the joke.His kid has done nothing wrong in her life. Kobe on the other hand got caught cheating and looks like he, at worst raped a maid in a hotel, and at best took advantage of her in the worst way.Years ago HBO Real Sport did a story about him and how he always gets around in a helicopter. I guess to get around all the traffic in LA. I remember watching that and telling my wife how scary that would be....[deleted]A lot of commentators on TV praising how no one compares to Kobe\\'s greatness, but they conveniently forget about Lebron and Michael Jordan. Both of those guys have already eclipsed Bryant on the court and are great icons for their city, not to mention a great family man.people get really attached to people they dont even knowI believe  there were other people too.  Seven other people as well as this man and his kid. All equally dead.I have no idea who kobe or his daughter are so all these deaths are equally tragic.Rip 9 people who died needlessly.TheMan The Myth The Legendhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P_S4m1vfR8&feature=youtu.beA simple training exercise that\\'s utterly terrifying and shows what might have happened\"The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do \". - Kobe Bryant Rest in peace 🖤It’s been 24 hours and it still hasn’t hit me. This isn’t real life. RIP mamba. You accomplished so much but you still had a whole life ahead of you.I feel terrible for his wife, can’t imagine losing both your husband and daughter all at once.[removed]Anyone know who the other seven were on the helicopter of the details of how/why it crashed?didnt really know him but i know what it feels like to lose someone weather that be a singer, actor or even a person you know in person and by in person i dont mean breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend i mean death wise.I cant imagine his daughters mind when she was about to crash and end it all there, death is hard i have to admitit fucking sucks and im sorry for swearing but to be honest it does suckRest in peace manIs it known who the pilot wasWell, if there is an afterlife, mamba is taking the big man on 1 v 1, using that nasty fadeaway.20 hours later, it still doesn\\'t feel real,He had been my idol ever since I started to watch NBA 15 years ago, his  death is clearly too soon. No one expecting a guy that going to start his second phase of life passing in such a devastating way.RIP mamba, you\\'ll never be forgotten.Not sure if this has been asked but why isn’t there some sort of dash cam for helicopters? Lots of cars have it these days and they are super cheap. A cam connected to black box with direct recording and loop would provide many answers.Haven\\'t done too much looking, but  I haven\\'t heard what Shaq had to say about this.Why would you not drive from Point A to Point B in this scenario. Or is traffic in LA that bad where you’ll risk a flight in poor conditions???The amount of helicopter crashes in ny and nyc near me are frighteningly increasing in frequency. Most often pilot error. But regardless I have zero desire to fly in copters ever I think at this point. At least in an airplane you still maintain aerodynamic capabilities of engine failure occurs or something of the sort and can attempt a landing. A helicopter is literally a flying car, once those blades stop functioning your falling out of the sky in a metal box. RIPrip man. what a tragedyMade me remember the Drazen Pitrovic car crash...Life is short man.damn.this is sooooo sad .words can’t tell my feelings.Everything dies. The Grim Reaper comes for EVERYTHING and EVERYONE.Maybe im biased but I can\\'t think of any other celebrity death as high profile as Kobe\\'s happening in my lifetime. Maybe MJ but that had controversy attached to it. Other than that I feel like you have to go all the way back to John Lennon for something comparableIt’s a real shame as the pilot or whoever was behind his ear really wanted to hurry to the game or watever. It could have been prevented with some common sense like if I’m flying towards a mountain area I should be high especially with a heavy fog.I assume all these deleted posts in the controversial sorting are from people mentioning is rape caseThis is terrible news. I wish his family the best.I\\'m heartbroken. Watching him play all 20 years, I grew up on Kobe, I\\'m 29. I cannot believe he\\'s gone. Wish the NBA changed their logo to him. RIP Kobe[deleted]https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qSLiIQcRbtw&feature=youtu.beI absolutely feel for Kobe’s young family and loved ones, this is no doubt a tragedy. But I can’t even imagine what the woman he raped must be going through to see everyone fawn over him like a God just died.Here\\'s a pic of him in that chopperhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRU8p9VX4AAq3t6?format=jpg&name=smallRest in Peace from a Pistons fan, and to all lost in the crash.  My God comfort your loved ones.I get that it\\'s big news.  But 200K up votes on a story about a guy being killed is... odd.August 24th at 8:24 PM should become official kobe remembrance day? 8/24 at 8:24.[removed]No, I haven’t and this is actually the first time I’ve heard of it. I’m researching it now and it looks promising. Have you gone through the program?If you don’t mind sending me a private on the topic. Thanks so muchHe had a killer instinct. He could see moves ahead of his competition. When he was with Shaq the Lakers couldn\\'t be stopped. Shaq however wasn\\'t as dedicated and it killed their relationship. If he had been they could have won 6 rings. 2004 could have been their year. He was brutal on the court. High IQ, speed, power, and cunning. Hes on Rushmore. Solidified as one of the greats. Bill Russell has rings, Wilt could score like crazy, Jordan was well the second coming, Kobe was a hitman. An assassin. The league was stacked then. Lebron, Bosh, Wade put in Miami. Parker, Ginobili, and Duncan in San Antonio. The amount of future hall of Famers he was against was unreal. But he didnt care. Los Angeles was his team, his city, and the west was his conference. He was the king of his time. Problem with being a king is that the reign is short and competition is fierce. Gold medals, scoring titles, MVP, championships, all stars, first team, the accolades go on and on. Dude won an oscar even. We wont ever know what his hall of fame speech would be. But if it was like anything else he did it would have been an instant classic. Duncan and Garnett are also eligible this year. But can\\'t nobody see past that purple and gold. And I\\'m a Spurs fan.Everybody\\'s talking about how Kobe died, and I feel like tons of people dont know that his daughter died to.All the money in the world doesn’t matter when your time on earth ends. I pray he had faith.RIP to the others people too. Poor them they died and no one cares because they are \"nobody\"Just got out of my night shift. Was pretty much crying all the time during my working hours.  Still can\\'t believe this. I really don\\'t want to. I remember waking up to the news. At first I was getting phone calls from friends. But at the time I ignored the calls because I was trying to get some sleep. Since I just worked a 12-hour shift the night before. When I did actually awake. I was very tired. Blurry vision, slight headache, mentally out of it, You know the usual symptoms from being really exhausted. Picked up my phone and just saw a text from a friend that just said \"Kobe man\". I knew exactly what that meant but I was in denial. Then when I actually checked the news and saw proof. Vision became clear, headache went away, tiredness went away. I immediately jumped off the bed and just yelled \"What!!\" At the top of my lungs. Then I started crying.I never tonight a celebrity\\'s death would ever hit me that hard. RIP Kobe. You don\\'t even understand how much you changed my life.So sad, just goes to show anything can happen to anyone at anytimeIt\\'s only January what the fuckHis poor 13. Year old daughter died too 😭[deleted]I didn\\'t know who he is, or what he did, but i do know his name from hearing it mentioned a lot. He must have been crazy important.EDIT: my phone autocorrected \"didn\\'t\" to \"don\\'t\". Clearly I know who he is now. It was a sign of respect that someone who isn\\'t even American, and has zero interest in ANY sport let alone Basketball would know his name.Man was a absolutely legend of the game yes he has a few dark moments of it in he\\'s personal life but a legend on the court r.i.p Kobe 🏀[removed]It is just really sad to think about it. He was a really good person, and the thing that he was in the helicopter with GiGi... Just... Rest In Peace :( 😭[deleted][deleted]One last \"KOBE!\" for our boy! RIP big dawgPetition to make Kobe Bryant the new NBA logo:http://chng.it/2Wh4QNsL7PWhy can\\'t it be some mass murderer politician or royal just fucking once, ever? Don\\'t tell me there\\'s a god, don\\'t tell me karma exists.[removed]This post has 2 awards called “Made me smile”??[deleted]It\\'s crazy how many awards this news get 😂🤣The rewards for this are a bit off “MOOD”, “Made me Laugh” and “Wholesome”As a cavs fan I awaited kobe to fail so Lebron could overtake him in the early 2000s. It broke my heart to hear kobe died. I’m still crying 18 hours later getting ready for work. I miss you kobe.[deleted]Some commented kn twitter in 2013 that kobe would die jn a helicopter crash. He went everywhere in a helicopter.I was eating chicken wings when this happened. sucks.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRrYzII86aY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRrYzII86aY) this is what it looks like in foggy conditionsInstead of sihtting stories for karma. A comment explaining why and how this happened would be nice. I didn\\'t knew him much but it\\'s still sad.This is how the world priorotises things, kobe bryants death is overshadowing the coronovirus news. Kobe bryant\\'s death affects one family, choronavirus affects the survivial of a large proportion of the human race.I dont feel this was an accident[deleted]One of the things that hurts so much for me amongst the many reasons is because Kobe was living such a happy life. He was content with his career, had a beautiful daughter and lots of hobbies and interests to pursue. I\\'m gutted.This is absolutely unreal. May he and his daughter rest in peace.[deleted]It must suck to be some of the lesser known people that died in this crash. When I die I hope I’m not with anyone famous.People mourn for millionaires like this and cathedrals. Its so weird. I dont get it. No disrispect, but people die everyday. rip.We\\'re not even at the end of January and world goes to shit already...Rest in peace Kobe and Gigi...such heartbreaking news...Guess I’m the only one who remembers he raped a women. I know I won’t miss him. The other losses are tragic. Not his.[removed]I have one request for Lebron right now, win the CHAMPIONSHIP for Kobe 💪🏽🏆🥇It\\'s a sad news, RIP, and you\\'ll always be in our hearts.Brutally killed by helicopter..Coincidence? Just weird: https://www.google.com/search?q=kobe+bryant+helicopter+toy&source=lnms&tbm=ischWhy were they flying so low? If visibility was bad isn\\'t it much safer to fly at higher altitudes?I feel \\'threatened\\'. Ban so and so.They released all the names of the victims. A mother, father and daughter that leave behind a son and daughter. Another woman and daughter. Finally another woman who leaves behind a husband and children. May they are all rest in peace.[deleted]I guess his landing was a slam dunk. 😏Helicopter crash... what a glorious way to go out... Rest in peace Kobe :(I hope I don\\'t sound like I\\'m downplaying the tragedy of a man and his young daughter both dying in an accident, but if I ever lose a loved one in a multi-death event I will probably be angry at all the focus being on the one celebrity who happened to be involved.It\\'s a shame that I just read that he was a rapist. Still, no one deserves this, especially his daughter, and especially not when it leaves a full family suffering.[deleted]Crying so hard rn and I\\'m not even a basketball fan..so fucking tragic. I cant IMAGINE how his family and friends feelWhat a sad news to wake up to. Condolences to all the families affected by this tragedy. RIP brother.RIP all 9 of them. As tragic as this is, this thread has shown me a lot about reddit. Sad in more ways than oneIt goes to show how precious life really is one day you can be healthy, happy and then the next day you might never get to do it again. This really shows that you should make today count because you never know what can happen tomorrow. R.I.P Kobe Bryant your forever in our hearts.Died playing the greatest position a man could ever play, a Father. My heart breaks knowing that in those last moments he couldnt protect his baby girl. I hope she was overwhelmed by his love in those last few seconds. RIPJust saying to give a dudes death awards is kinda messed upIt’s starting to seem like maybe helicopters are not the safest mode of transportation.The heli flew into a mountain going 185 mph. He didn\\'t suffer.Funny how all the bad things get mentioned once he\\'s dead. You know. The same people that refused to while he was aliveDidn’t this guy rape a woman ?I don\\'t watch basketball but I know that this man was very inspiring for many people.I feel sorry for his fans. May Kobe Bryant, his daughter and the other victims rest in peace.[deleted]I don\\'t watch basketball, so i know very little about Kobe Bryant, only that he is a famous and well known basketball player. My heart goes out to everyone. To all the people who died in this crash, i hope you are at peace. And to the families, relatives, friends, and people that knew the victims, i hope you too can find some semblance of peace. I don\\'t really know what else to say, other than that i feel bad that their lives, of everyone who died, got cut short. Rest In Peace to all the victims. Kobe is probably teaching basketball to everyone up in heaven.I\\'ll say a little prayer for everyone affected by this tragedy. Peace, everyone ❤This resonates with me on several levels. Death doesn\\'t discriminate. It can be so abrupt.  Yes, as an avid NBA fan I appreciate Kobe\\'s amazing abilities--but to me this is more a stark reminder that money means nothing (outside of food, shelter, and basic needs). Many of us have lost loved ones so quickly- and this reminds me of that. Truly tasting life is acting as if you would die tomorrow.  Be good to one another and make sure your priorities are in line. Much love to you allMahalo nui loa Kobe Bryant, ah hui hou. Aloha to everyone affected. I can only imagine he has golden tickets to many havens and a nice place in Valhalla.So sad man... I grew up shouting \"Kobe\" everytime I threw something. Such a great loss... RIP LegendLiterally crying right now and have been all day. So sad. Life is precious.[deleted]As if 2020 wasn’t already bad enough[deleted]I knew it was a helicopter crash as soon as I heard the newsWhy do helicopters accidents seem to be much more common than say plane accidents?[removed][deleted][deleted].......KoytoAni,Mr.Stan Lee,and now Kobe? What just happened to the world?Damn... never been a basketball guy, but I\\'ve heard of this legend\\'s exploits. May Gaia grant him and Gianna peace now, along with all the others that passed in this crash.RIP Mamba, Its a sad day to the sport world.Still so unreal to me... and I just can’t sleep tonight.Rest in greatness, Kobe Bean Bryant and Gianna Maria Onore Bryant 💜💛♾I don’t even watch basketball and I know who this guy is. Fuck[deleted]So fucking tragic for Kobe and his family :(As a Spurs fan, I didn\\'t like Kobe because of the rivalry in the 2000\\'s. But as guys like Kobe and Duncan got older, you started to respect their game. Best Kobe moment was the game he tore his Achilles.  He still took the free throws before being taken out of the game.I am literally beside myself. He was such an incredible human doing so many good things. I just will never understand why people like him and his daughter and the other family have to die when there are so many terrible people walking this earth.Isn\\'t it odd that it states \"killed\" instead of \"died\" ?i will also like to see people sending prayers to the pilot it would prob be devastating for his family:([deleted][removed]Im not allowed to make a joke about him dying?! Thats just not fair! I had a real 3 pointer lined up in my head ready!I knew about Kobe but I just found out aboit the kids. That makes me sick.https://web.archive.org/save/https://wgntv.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryants-helicopter-was-previously-owned-by-the-state-of-illinois/Sounds so unreal. RIP to Kobe, his daughter and those other passengers.i still cannot believe thisKobe told me not to worry about other people\\'s problems. I\\'m not sweating or losing sleep over this. I\\'m following his advice to the letter.What a positive influence he was to society. May he rest in peace.Do they know why it crashed? I’m at work and can’t read the article. I hope he didn’t have the same fate as Aaliyah.Not follower of any sports really. Was he big In basketball?Did TMZ air the news before the family know? That would he some cold heartless crap!Every time I read this I still can’t believe it.I did not realize he was so young. I am 47. Very sobering. RIP.aren\\'t there posts circling about how his death was predicted years ago in a helicopter accident?He will be remembered for a long time.  His legacy will carry on past earth, past the aliens, to the edge of time.  He went out in style. Rip kobe beef and kobe beef jr.[deleted]Man, Kobe was one of the few individuals that went from doing some pretty bad things earlier on in life, to genuinely becoming a good person. Let him remind us all that bad people can change and that not all hope is lost for someone just because of some of their previous decisions. RIP Kobe and Gianna, your lives were and will always be a positive influence for people all around the globe.[deleted][deleted]Let’s drop 40 million dislikes if Kobe don’t end up on 2020 rewindMan anyone else feels like this is just a bad dream?I’m so sad. Kobe was like a Dad to me. 😢This is so painful. Even now I’m still having a hard time processing the events that have unfolded. How can Kobe his daughter and all those other poor people just be gone in an instant? Life can be such a Terrible tragedy.[removed]I just fucking cried for 10 minutes man. God damn it+ Rest In Peace to the 8 other people that perished in the crash.Maybe, instead of saying ‘Kobe’ when throwing something, we should say: ‘For Kobe’god how could this happen.... another legend taken away from usYou just never expect these things to happen. Incredibly sad.What...would it be like to die in a helicopter crash? I hope there’s no pain.Somehow this makes me think of a line in ERB Jim Henson vs Stan Lee: \"It\\'s like watching a beautiful sunset .... at noon.\"  Then Jim reminds Stan that he\\'s woven an indelible legacy already.  I think a similar thing applies here.&#x200B;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXBJIZ1NXFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXBJIZ1NXFU)  if you want to take a ganderI get chills down my spine. Kobe being gone just doesn’t feel real. He was one of those legends you thought would be here forever. I’m crushed that as a fan, i’ll never get to sit and talk with the legend that was Kobe Bean Bryant 🤞🏽Why does the top comment say making jokes will get you banned, isn’t the point of Reddit but it’s a free speech platform where are uses downvote nasty comments?[removed]Fucking helicopters, claimed so many incredible lives.ATC was pretty quiet.  They were transitioning to another airspace and just lost contact completely.  Not even a mayday or emergency declared.https://youtu.be/B0pQfgi9ZqUNo one seems to care about the other victims.A lot of things can be said about Kobe Bryant. I\\'ve heard a lot of slander and definitely a lot of praise. As a Kobe fan, i found it difficult to not utterly destroy the cowards who choose to speak ill of the dead. People seem to forget that his daughter was in this crash, and utter words so carelessly that are not only hurtful, but definitely unwarranted. They all seem to refer to the 2003 incident. 17 Years ago. One incident does not define a man, and neither do ALLEGATIONS.All the good that he has done and the impact that he has had on the world was tremendous. This one definitely hurts because we are so used to Kobe Bean Bryant defying the impossible, and doing the improbable. It\\'s so hard to accept that Kobe is gone.Show us one last trick Kobe, show us that this is a sick joke. RIP to everyone on that helicopter.better title: Some Guy\\'s TVhttps://uk.flightaware.com/live/flight/N72EXThe pilot knew shit was bad look how many times he circled....  He should have landed ASAP or climbed higher, The speed ramped up drastically before impact as well was this to gain more altitude?  Poor guy... :(Rest In Peace Black Mamba and his daughter and the others involved in the crash. Truely upsetting news.I never liked the guy. I wonder how many homeless people or people who couldn\\'t afford healthcare died today. That\\'s a bigger story.Fuck- an absolute tragedyIt’s so sad that those girls were on that chopper.[removed][removed]damn...he is the reason we all say \"kobeee\" when throwing something...a legend died here, rip.Ok but we all talking ab two people like the rest that died in the helicopter don’t matter cause of their statusI keep coming back to reddit to hope this was a huge misunderstanding. Fuck. He even looks like Tupac. Too early and 2 of LAs greats.I had to do a double take when I read this. it\\'s so surreal, I always thought people like Kobe would live a ripe old age. this headline is honestly 20 years too early in my mind, I always thought that when Kobe Bryant die, that I would share a moment of silent with my children over his death. I\\'m only 25, barely out of college, and hunting for jobs. at least I can share this moment with my father, we loved watching the lakers when I was growing up.Ill miss him so much... Big part of my childhood. R.I.PThe awards given are kinda fucked upLike... “Wholesome”“Heart Eyes”“Made me smile”“Mood”Dang, RIP black Mamba. I pray for his wife and daughters.So many lives changed in so many different ways. Rest up legend ✊🏻Damn i was so shook when i heard the news.This life is too short. I\\'m at loss of words after this one. May they rest in peace. 😞RIP Kobe. Thanks for the wisdom you left with the world: [15 Inspiring Quotes Kobe Bryant Left With the World](https://calvinrosser.com/kobe-bryant-quotes/).[deleted]My fiancé who isn’t a basketball fan is all upset tonight - but thens of thousands of people die everyday- yet the world doesn’t blink an eye.  She is upset w/ me now because of “my sterile view” .I’m not cold - but don’t know how to address her anger w/ me.RIP Kobe... You\\'ll never be forgotten for decades..Im not into basketball and i know shit about him.. but its sad cause he and his daughter died.I just wish people would also honor the others that died instead of just Kobe and his daughter just because he was famous and an icon a life is a life no matter whose it was,R.I.P to all that passedAs I told my brother, never will I ever take a helicopter tour over NYC or over the Hawaiian jungle.The first thing I saw when I refreshed twitter was “KOBE BRYANT DIES IN HELICOPTER CRASH” from TMZ. I brushed off thinking it was just a cruel joke to get views, but every hour that passed, it was starting to hit me. I immediately called my brother who has been a Lakers fan since the early ‘90s, as well as my sisters. I was never into basketball but I knew how much Kobe meant to my family. We grew up seeing him join the Lakers, and retiring. My brother met him a couple of times, and would always talk to him and his family. My heart feels numb, and I’m in disbelief. My condolences go out to his family, and the families of the others on board as well.I was at church when phone rang Kobe is kil NoRip Kobe and Gigi. Most inspiring person of my generation.Bryant\\'s very last tweet congratulates LeBron on passing him in total score.I\\'m sitting here watching his 81 point game. They have the full recording on youtube. With oldschool commercials and everything. It seems surreal. But I\\'m getting lost in it. Rest in peace kobe. You made me want to be a beast in basketball when I was youngerWhenever I would play a pick up game of basketball there would always be one person shouting Kobe!! whenever they took their shot. There are very few sportsman that would have that effect even in a small pick up game.I can’t sleep. This story has my mind wandering.This is one of the most horrific and disturbing things that I have seen in awhile. Rest In Peace to both Kobe and Gianna Bryant. I can\\'t even imagine the pain their family must be going through.There are way to many helicopter and small plane crashes in the US. We only hear about them when a \"celebrity\" dies. Not to take away from kobe or his kid. But these devastations happen all the time.Maybe a pilot or flight professional can explain some basics to me how a helicopter can crash so violently??? It appears Bryant and company were flying near 200mph equivalent and collided with the hill/mountain. I get that. Basic physics. I am confused about \\\\*if they experienced engine trouble (say a cascading-type of failure) then why wasn\\'t it possible to slow down considerably and hover down safely at the first sign of trouble??Obviously if visibility was bad due to weather/fog and they collided with the mountain at full speed there\\'s no arguing. However, if there was engine trouble (possible fire), how quickly can a helicopter going that speed slow down and hover to the ground if not safely then at a speed that may increase chances for survival?? I figure helicopters can land pretty much anywhere on land, yes?I am just so fucking sad after getting off work and being able to reflect.Have y’all heard this? Real or fake https://youtu.be/tiMdRdufUzMA heart breaking moment for the family. His wife and daughters will be devastated. He carried himself post career with a grace, curiosity and humility that we can all aspire to.I have never seen Kobe play one second of ball and I know nothing about him, but somehow I miss him.Definitely a sad day, especially given that his daughter and others fell victim to the same fate. There is no doubt that he is an NBA legend, which no one can take away from him, but he also wasn’t the great guy everyone makes him out to be. Not sure if anyone remembers the famous rape case, but he did it and ruined that girl’s life to save his own image.I’m at an age where I watched Jordan, Kobe, and LeBron while I grew up loving and playing the game.  A legend for many reasons, but hearing all the stories people have about him makes it hurt even more.  His work ethic and mentality is a legacy even non-sports fans can appreciate and his humble nature toward others who looked up to him is something everyone should try to emulate.I feel so fucking depressed right now.RIP to all lost and comfort to all family members. Life is random.Keep milking that karma boiissssWhy is this one hitting me the hardest? Seems like this one is hitting many hard, too.As a lifelong basketball player and fan, this really hurts. While I was younger while Jordan was playing, Kobe was only four years older than me, so I damn near watched every game. This is just unreal. The worst part was GiGi was just getting started. Nothing but love and warmth to Vanessa and the other daughters. This just sucks.Speechless. RIP to the Mamba and his beautiful daughter GiannaI can’t even IMAGINE what Vanessa is going through right now. Seriously.My heart is broken, and seeing people say negative things on a day like this is just awful. Not even gonna try to be eloquent. Fuck this sucks. And fuck you if you’re gonna be a dick today.The news shook me and many others.. RIP kobe and gigi may God give your family the strength they need at this time. I\\'m devastatedThis and Steven Hawking really remind me that even celebrities can die at any time. I suppose I will realize this more and more as I get older, doesn\\'t feel real.I don\\'t know much about Kobe or Kobe\\'s daughter, or ALL those other people on that helicopter.KOBE BRYANT WAS A RAPIST https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant_sexual_assault_caseThe day he dies, and the front page of the LA Times sport section is about him getting passed by Lebron James. Wow.he died. how wholesome. who tf thought it would be a good idea to give this the wholesome award, jeezThis whole situation is just so fucking tragic....fuckRemember when he raped someone in 2003?Never heard of him but condolence to the family anyway.[removed]Grew up on his ball playing, and to hear both Kobe and his daughter died in such a violent way leaves an empty feeling.  Just hurts.I wish this was a horrible misunderstanding. I can’t believe it’s real. My heart breaks for his family. So horrible.The two things that just tear me up inside are imagining how his wife and surviving children are feeling right now, and how he must have felt in the seconds before his crash, with his daughter. I hope the surviving family members of the passengers can find peace, and I hope the passengers of the helicopter had no idea they were crashing.[removed]Does anybody know *why* the helicopter crashed ?Serious question: does Lebron ride into the staples center for games/use a helicopter?Every time I hear of a tragedy like this I contemplate how could it have been avoided.  We don\\'t know the circumstances that lead to this but we need to study them to ensure it never happens again!  We are all on this Earth to work together to advance life. Don\\'t leave it to someone else. Whenever you see a situation that could lead to something dangerous please don\\'t ever say, \"that could never happen\" because it can.  Always wear your seatbelt, eat healthier, give a lonely introvert a hello and ask how they are, turn your blowers on before starting your boat engines, ensure all weapons are stored in locked boxes, teach your children not to bully and ensure they aren\\'t being bullied, put your phone down when crossing the street, ignore that text while driving, check all safety equipment a few times.  Anything you can can do, please do it!  You never know.RIP KobeI feel so sorry for his wife Vanessa. How horrible to lose family members like this, but not be able to grieve because you have to parent other children. I think she has three remaining? Bless her.I’m still in shock.   Been crying off and on all day watching tributes pouring in.I did some research and this MIGHT be pilot error, the pilot was flying in SFVR conditions which means that they are below VFR(flying with your eyes) requirements at one point the cloud base was forecasted at 1100ft and the pilot was at 1400. When the pilot was speaking to radar after hia two SFVR transitions (flying through two different tower\\'s air spaces) he was speaking with radar and they said he was too low for flight following which is offering radar services. Then moments before the crash the pilot climbed 700ft in 3 seconds. I am an air traffic controller and one you see a VFR aircraft climbing that fast its usually to avoid something. He was probably too low and couldn\\'t see how low he actually was and hit terrainI am so shocked. Such a devastating thing to happen.1 of about 4,173,541 dead and counting since 12:01am this mornings UTC.A tragic end to a great man...Rip legend. Loved this man. What a bad news to start the day. (European)[deleted][removed]Gonna sort by controversial here...I\\'m so sad. I\\'m crying on the way to work.I named my cat Kobe a few years ago. My cat recently went missing :(Now Kobe is gone. What a nightmare.https://mobile.twitter.com/dotNoso/status/268466325842694144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-20841458643038619478.ampproject.net%2F2001071857360%2Fframe.html[deleted]Thank you Kobe may you Rest In Peace right next to your princess!I grew up nowhere near L.A or America. Watching Kobe growing up taught me 3 things. Hardwork, dedication and a competitive drive. These 3 things translated into my work ethic today and all thanks to Kobe I\\'m making a comfortable living not because I\\'m talented but because he taught me the mindset of be the hardest worker in the room. Thanks for all the memories and the inspirations you have given us and to the millions of us out there you are greater than a basketball player. You are our hero. Forever the greatest. Kb8/24Who put the wholesome reward?Sadly they weren’t the only ones who died and they’ll be forgotten and overlooked even though loved ones lost their mother, father,  son,  daughter, uncle, aunt, etc.   Kobe and his daughter were just one of 9 who died on that doomed flight.   God bless them all.[\"7 out of 10 aviation crashes are NOT accidental.\"](https://twitter.com/OndoFirstBorn/status/1221531081184145411?s=20) -QI don’t know how to process this. How are you guys coping with this news? I didn’t care much for basketball/NBA for the past 12-15 years, but I loved Kobe. I’m kind of shocked, just waiting for it to set in tomorrow...[deleted]Yo this fucked me up. People we see as invincible cut short. Cherish every day yall, Chase greatness and be happy.I just found out about Kobe less than 5 minutes ago. This new year has had one of the worst beginnings ever for me personally.  :(  Please let it get better soon.  I\\'m still trying to shake the flu this week, so everything is already foggy and surreal to me.Yo fuck the awards on this post, they\\'re so insincere and some are straight up garbage. Idk who thinks it\\'s funny to give the fucking seal with heart eyes or wholesome ones, but it\\'s not. Screw offToo many sports related  helicopter crashes. NFL, NBA .The last time people reacted so personally devastated by the death of a famous person was when Paul Walker died. Like they had a short life that was taken so horribly in an accident, not old age or from a publicly know battle with cancer  or other disease. Shit is crazy man.2020 star with big surprises .The time I became kind of a basketball fan was when they had their rivalry against the Celtics (was it 2010s?) and me and my dad would get up early  to watch live broadcasts of the Playoffs and the Finals (we live in the Philippines). I remember thinking at the time that Kobe is amazing.A lot of my friends seriously play basketball because they were inspired by him.His reach exceeded more than just basketball.May the light be with all casualties and their families. RIP.Nike needs to have a super bowl commercial in his memory. Will go down as one of the greatest commercials of all time\"You asked for my hustle, i gave you my heart\" Can someone explain me what does it mean? (English isn\\'t my first language)I shit you not but I heard about this during a test takers SAT session today. The instructor just went “WHAT THE FUCK, KOBE BRYANT IS DEAD?!?!!” This was a complete shock to everyone.“For me to make the trip up to Staples Center, that means I’m missing an opportunity to spend another night with my kids when I know how fast it goes. … I want to make sure the days that I’m away from them are days that I absolutely have to be. I’d rather be with them than doing anything else.” Kobe Bryant - LA TimesCan we confirm for sure none of his other children were with him? I know they said 9 including the pilot. I think two people are still unidentified.I still can\\'t believe it; all I can think of is \"why?!\"Hikers in the area heard the engine sputtering before they saw it crash.  The hikers called 911.And people say I should still go on an airplane or helicopter to \"experience the world\". Yeah... screw thatI’m a Celtics fan. Kobe was a monumental part of my childhood. This is just earth shattering. I’m heartbroken. He was so amazing for so many things within and beyond basketball. Rest In Peace. He was gone too soon.Why did someone give this the Wholesome award?I wish more information was available about the crash and why it happened.My cousin said he’s a rapist, is that bullshit?Why are there made me smile and heart eye awards?his two young girl will grow up never knowing him, yet will be constantly be told all their lives how great their father was.  sadIn a 2018 interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Kobe Bryant said **Gianna** wanted to play in the WNBA \"for sure.\"  He said that fans would say \"you and V gotta have a boy ... someone to carry on the tradition.\"  And **Gianna** would interrupt and respond, \"I got this.\" He called her the heir to his legacy. RIP Kobe and Gianna.This is so surreal man.Things like this happen everydayThe fact that it happened to a celebrity family, it does bring it to greater attention. And it really makes you think...41 and 13 years old. Both so young, and precious gems to the whole of mankind.I would just say the universe is chaotic and unbiased, but... no.It’s just bullshit.Like, pure bullshit.Hello, God? Whatever your name is? Yeah, uh, I need to speak to your manager.Because your existence is bullshit.How is it people like this are ripped of their entire lives, yet we have idiots and purely diabolical obsequious narcissists who run the world into the ground and completely stomp all over humanity without any sort of mortal judgement?This timeline is just such ostentatious bullshit...[removed]My classmate just died in that crash along with her mom, I don\\'t know what to do.Thank you for your support🙏[removed]Truly shocking. Thoughts to his family for the loss of himself and his daughter. Well done champ.RIP Mamba and his daughter. Really devastating news to hear him pass away so soon, especially when he just recently retired. Him and Shaq were the reason I started watching and playing basketball as a kid. Kobe will always be one of my role models, and his words will continue to inspire me to be a better *me*.Why does this have so many awards? It’s a news article.Dumb question, but Kobe wasn\\'t flying the helicopter, was he? And also, just curious, what is up with his kids all having Italian names?Now whenever I play pubg and throw a grenade I\\'m going to be sad :\\'(... Father and his daughter dead.Condolences to the familySomeone gave this a wholesome award, what the hellAnd the made me smile oneKnowing you are gonna die but that your daughter is also going down, one of the worst ways to go, no father should ever have to go through this. Rip Kobe and Gianna, they deserved way better than this, nobody deserves something this terrible. I don’t even watch basketball and this is hitting me.I may have not liked him much as a Celtics fan, but this is a very sad day for me and my fellow NBA fans.My heart aches even if I\\'m not a basketball fan. I know Kobe because my dad and mom are both fan of Lakers. Rest in peace to Kobe and his daughter, Gigi and the rest who were with them.[removed]I had my phone on airplane mode then I took it off and decided to get on twitter to see what\\'s happening. I see the #1 trend is Kobe and think to myself \"hmm, probably about him getting passed by lebron or something\" then I my eyeball sees the second trend \"Damn Kobe\" then the third trend \"Not Kobe\" then \"Wtf Kobe\"...ShockwavesI still can’t believe itOk 9 people died...so who are the other humans?I shared of photo of my sister and dad. Thanks for the support everyone! https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/euiirn/my_sister_also_lost_her_life_today_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfRip kobe. I don\\'t even watch basketball but his name is a household name. What a tragedy.I feel so bad for the families, I doubt they’ll ever see this but sorry for your lossesIt just doesn’t make any sense.I was too young to really appreciate the Showtime Lakers. Kobe and Shaq were my Magic and Worthy. Kobe was a villain in the NBA. Kobe was the antagonist that gave the storyline substance. Kobe kept the plot thickening. Kobe brought drama and excitement to the game. He dedicated all of his life to the progress of the sport. He was a champion and will always be a legend. Los Angeles mourns for you Kobe Bryant and thanks you for your work ethic and loyalty. May you find peace.Nine people died... RIP to AllHe was a real life super hero..someone you thought would be around for years and just to have his life cut so tragically short 😕RIP Kobe.And let me just say anyone wishing death on anyone else, even if you think that person deserves it, is a complete piece of shit.[removed]Feeling sad for him☹️Of all the deaths that have happened recently this one has been hitting me weird. He was in the prime of his life with no illness, and she was only 13. Not to mention all the other people on board. Such a tragic loss of life. I’ve put so much in perspective in the last 8 hours.[removed]Thank you so much.  I don’t know why but when something bad happens in my life, somebody else’s life, the world, I get a handle on things by trying to figure out what the heck happened. This helps a great deal. Thanks again for your thoughtfulness.[removed]Gregg Popovich after today’s game:     >“Good game, tough loss, who cares”      Even the Raptors players looked really depressed.[deleted]Death is a strange thing because it is so hard to wrap your head around it, the most common reaction is to go to how we feel about it, but Id encourage everone to place yourselves for a moment in the victim\\'s shoes,  the fear of plummeting to earth holding your loved ones knowing your going to die is unfathomable to me, my thoughts and prayersFuck this shit, 170k upvotes a ddozens of gildings? People care more about an overpaid athlete than a hundreds of people and their families who died in a plane just the other day.Fuck you Reddit.When shooting your crumpled paper into the trash can it\\'s no longer \"KOBE\"... it\\'s \"For Kobe\" #MambaForeverIts almost always pilot errorHaven’t felt like this since Carrie FisherWhat I wanna know, is, was this dude just commuting in a helicopter all the time? Or was this like an ultra special occasion?This is one of the saddest things I have seen in a very very long time.I have no words. Rest in peace Kobe 🙏🏼I am not a b ball fan or follower of Kobe as an athlete. There is no question he was extremely talented. What really hits home here is this was not a person that was ‘supposed’ to die. This is not someone who is playing with drugs/ skydiving without a parachute/ in the front lines of a senseless war. This is what makes us realize how precious life is because there is no knowing when suddenly someone will not be there anymore. It really should make us all turn and embrace those we love.Is it weird that I want to downvote this to express that I am unhappy about it? Like...it doesn’t feel right to upvote it. (BTW I didn’t downvote it.)Question would making jokes about hitler or something against the rulesThis is horrible. That said, helicopters are massively complex machines and seem to crash more than most aircraft; they are the sort of thing I wouldn\\'t use regularly unless it was an emergency.This year is just sucking already. Neil Peart, now this...fuck.I\\'m actually feeling hurt and that\\'s rare for me. I really respected this guy even though I never knew or met him. 😭😭😭😭😭R.I.P KB, GB AND OTHERS LOSTRIP to the GOAT, Kobe Bryant, and his beautiful daughter. My condolences to his family, and the families of those who lost loved ones in that tragic moment.Best of wish, to the Bryant family 🙏Kobe’s death is just way too tragic. He was a good man, athlete and father. The world will miss him very much.An absolutely to watch even to the most casual fan. A true competitor, kind to the fans and people he engaged with. Usually not shook at all by celebrity/famous deaths but this one sucks, he was just beginning life outside the game. RIP Kobe and others.Kobe, Paul Walker, and Robin Williams cut like knives into my soul. ;( I hate to keep losing parts of my childhood im not ready!I\\'m sorry but it wasn\\'t just Kobe that die, a 13 year old kid died too. it is still tragic as she was an innocent kidHe was way too young. Thanks for all the years of entertainment Kobe and inspiring future generations. You deserved a long retirement.OP has got the most upvoted posts for both Epstein and Kobe’s deaths. Who does he know...[deleted]I\\'m in tears. His 13 year old daughter was with him and then he also had a 17 year old, and a 3 year old and a 6 month old that won\\'t have any memories of their Daddy beyond what other people tell them. That poor family. RIP Kobe.not even February and a legend has already left us...Rest in peace,can\\'t believe it,pray for his family🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻The radio kfi out of Burbank said he would ride in a helicopter very often to games and practices.  Helicopters are seen so dangerousThrowing a crumpled up piece of paper into a trash can at a distance while shouting \"KOBE\" will never be the same.Why has the OP received hundreds of awards for posting something that went viral instantly???Don’t sort by controversial.Man, 2020 is taking a big fat dump on our chest and it\\'s only January!Does no one else find it crazy it’s not even 24hours after lebron moves past him in the all time points list?  I feel like this is just another Tupac situation. He’ll be back doing speeches as a hologramKobe is one of the biggest influences and names of the game of basketball the world will burn up before we forget a legend like this 🙏Lately after I cut my dogs hair I drop so many Kobe’s.  My dog now responds to kobe.This is still so surreal. I\\'m not even a Lakers fan or anything but I can\\'t think of any celebrity/athlete death over the years that has hit me as hard as this one. I\\'ve always just been a fan of basketball and had a ton of respect for Kobe. I feel so bad for his wife and kids especially knowing that his daughter was also killed in the crash. My thoughts also go out to the families of all the others killed in the crash. This is a sobering reminder that anyone can go in the most shocking and unexpected way.Bet God will have couple of fierce competitors #mambametanlity RIPI just wanna know who the fuck gave the heart eyes awardwhat, no damn really ?! was never a real NBA Fan but there was a time i was playing Basketball with Friends regularly and Kobe was my point for Reference on how to get better at the game. Was sitting whole evenings watching clips of him and later trying to mimick some of the stuff or get inspired atleast by it. His kid daughter dying alongside a few other People in that crash just leaves an even bigger bad taste...Not a big basketball person, but We lost an icon too soon. He was so young and talented. I can only imagine how his relatives and fans feel. He brought something to this world and left with it too.This is the worst thing to happen to things named Kobe since the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995.Why do people give Reddit awards like gold/platinum/silver to posts like theseStill can\\'t believe this happened. FUCKLoss of any human life is sad and tragic.He was the only worthy to be carried by shaq in his handsI can’t believe it’s real. His hard work and mentality is what I molded myself after. Rest In Peace Kobe and Gigi.I was watching a commercial for Turkish airline featuring Kobe and Messi on board this morning on YouTube. I\\'m not a fan of basketball and don\\'t know much about Kobe except for his name. But in that clip, he seemed a really amiable really sweet guy, competing with Messi to win the heart of a little boy that was undecided to ask for whose autograph lol. RIP Kobe and Gianna. You left us too soon.Leaving your house and returning safely is such an underrated blessing.[removed]This is devastating news!! I could believe when I read the headline and kept praying this was some fake news doing rounds of the internet! I cannot even comprehend the incredible loss his family faces!! RIP Kobe! Whatever it was you were a legend. No one should face such tragic death and eternal loss!Orange Coast College baseball coaching legend John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa were among the victims in Sunday\\'s helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, that killed NBA legend Kobe Bryant.[source](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28570865/orange-coast-college-baseball-coach-john-altobelli-helicopter-crash-victims) Those 3 names, Kobe, GiGi, Christine Mauser have been publicly identified.  So tragic.RIP Kobe.  I haven’t been able to think about anything else all day. I just sit here tonight holding my kids, life is too fragile.    I hope his family can find peace eventually.[removed][deleted][removed]What a year this month has been .This just breaks my heart. I can only imagine what his wife and kids are going through.Mark Cuban just announced that the Dallas Mavericks are retiring Number 24 because of Kobe’s accomplishments and his work as an ambassador for the sport of basketball[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\\\_of\\\\_accidents\\\\_and\\\\_incidents\\\\_involving\\\\_helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_helicopters) I can\\'t find any other fatality with that many dead (all) in a civilian helicopter.Who gave this a \"Made me Smile award\"Nine killed in helicopter crash including Kobe Bryant and his young teenage daughter*I woke up this morning and this is the first thing I saw on the news, I grew up watching Kobe until the day of his retirement from Basketball, As I was just sitting at my couch eating breakfast in silence and try to process what the hell.. is this even real?!!, It\\'s just devastating to me. RIP to the Bryant family and to the victims of the crash.There were a group of people outside Madison square garden tonight chanting “Kobe! Kobe! Kobe!” I’m not an nba fan but knew he was loved by many. RIP to him and his daughter and everyone else on board.Gigi was always with kobe for everything it seemed like. If it had just been him and she wasnt on the helicopter, I could’ve seen her living out her dream like her father wanted to of going into the WNBA and breaking records and basically living on not just her father’s basketball legacy but his legacy in general. Very sad to hear this news about both of themThis is absolutely heartbreaking. And I’m in no way shape or form a laker fan. Just one human feeling for the families of the one who were lost today. Maybe This might bring people closer in this country. Just horrific, so sorry, RIPGod bless you and your family Kobe Bryant.  Rest in peace!This feels like I’m on the wrong side of the Mandela Effect.Pretty sure the crash was due to the weather. Heavy fog in mountainous terrain? Common. Pilot must of had a good feeling about making it out, or was under pressure to keep Kobe on schedule.[removed]somebody can just stop 2020 ?!He was my favorite NBA player...I cant....how feasible is it to have parachutes in helicopters? Would it not improve your chances of living in emergency situations?The Lakers haven\\'t released a statement yet.kobe and 3 of his daughters died today. wtf is going on with all these people dyingEDIT: sorry it was just oneThis is just a tremendous loss. I was eating out tonight and they were showing some pregame tributes and I literally almost cried into my mashed potatoes.I\\'m still shocked with this. I was wearing my lakers Jersey 24 yesterday, when I saw the news I was devastated. We are only in the 1st month of the year and I already lost 3 amazing people (My cousin, Neil Peart that I grew up listening to and always loved Rush and now Kobe my childhood basketball idol.) 2020 isn\\'t being a good boy. I hope the following months are better for everyone this year!Why does this hurt so much? I never felt this way about a celebrity death. I\\'ve never felt this sick to my stomach. Why do I feel like I\\'ve lost a family member? I guess you never know how important people are to you until they\\'re gone, even people you never met before.Could they have survivied if they had jumped off the helicopter? given that it is very likely that they all died because of the fire, did they have some realistic chances if they had jumped before impact? serious question, I KNOW that you are going to take your odds inside the helicopter, but given that inside the helicopter u are going to die, did they have any chance jumping off just before impact?Of you take the GPS coordinates of the last ADSB location it’s 950ft.Remember when he jumped over the car?We need to make 8/24 National Kobe day where everyone needs to call \"Kobe\" and make any sort of basket in respect. Gone too soon.From the moment I started getting into basketball, I fell in love with kobes love for the game. Don\\'t think we\\'ll ever see another Kobe Bryant. RIP black mambaSo, so sad. Any updates on the identities of the other victims?I get it...Kobe was a tremendous athlete and will be deservedly remembered as one of the greatest basketball players to step onto the court. It’s horrible that he was killed. But reading all of these “heartbroken” comments from random Redditters who likely never met the guy, or even really followed his career, or the sport in general, is already getting old.The fact that one of the deceased passengers is a retired NBA player should  *NEVER*  overshadow the tragic loss of numerous other people, *ESPECIALLY* children - literal children. So please, pay your respects, but spare us the excessive crying emojis, “Man, what a year! Can we just start over?” and “fuck fuck fuck fuck!” type comments. Your temporary and likely unauthentic sorrow, over the death of one man you likely never met, will *NEVER*  be remotely comparable to the pain currently being experienced by the numerous families directly impacted and involved with this tragedy - especially the parents.Why do people take private helicopters and private jets, I literally only ever see millionaires and billionaires die in them, just seems like its inviting deathI was in a Vintage Stock at 1pm and everyone stopped what they were doing and started talking about. I had no clue what was happening. I couldn\\'t hear the name they were saying. A man pulled out his phone and called his friends. I heard them say, \"Kobe was only 41 and his daughter was with him.\" I just left the store. I had to go home. I didn\\'t know what to do.[removed]As a pilot I know exactly what happened. Kobe hired this guy to take him north. Weather was possibly below mins ... I heard reports that they circled a few times before proceeding. You gonna tell Kobe the weather is too bad? Na, just keep pressing. The weather will break. It didn’t and this is what happens. Not saying Kobe directly pressured the pilot but the pilot felt pressure to fly in unacceptable conditions. Shit happens all the time, can only imagine the pressure you would feel to push the weather if someone famous was your passenger.Wtf is going on in 2020? :(Sad day.  Gods speed and prayers to his family.I hope pictures of this never leak. He deserves to be remembered as he was. A giant- in more ways that one. We\\'ll never see his like again. Rest in peace.Does a helicopter have a black box like in the planes?[removed]He was just 41 but will be forever remembered as a giant among men.His youngest daughter will never know her dad or sister, that breaks my heart. Kobe seemed like one of the untouchable celebrities, one of the ones that you never think of them dying because it just seems impossible.OP, how do you feel being the one to post this important article? It must feel pretty crazy huh?Not even a laker fan just a basketball fan.  Kobe\\'s dear basketball speech just legit made me tear up.Rest easy with your little girl brother  - a knick fanKobe was supposed to be invincible... I still can’t accept the fact that he was in that helicopter with his daughter.. you’d think it would be like stuff in video games or movies where the protagonist survives the crash, but the reality of it not so much. Man Kobe was an icon it’s so surreal.R.i.p black mamba 🐍Every time I read this I still can’t believe it.[removed]Good forbid if a human being is flawed, we then have discount everything good they have done. The White Knights are here in full force.Shit, I haven\\'t felt a loss like this since Robin William\\'s death.Pilot error just pushing the boundaries of vfr by the sounds of the atc and weather reports.SadYou never know man.. rich or poor any day could be your last. Choke on some snack, fall and hit your head, plane crash, crushed between automatic gates like the fast and furious guy. Never been a big sports guy but even I know who he was. RIP. Such a shame his daughter was also on the flight.[removed]I have never cried over anyone but a family or someone close to me who has passed. I haven’t stopped shedding tears since I found out. Apart of my life since I was 11 years old.I’ve never felt this sad since the Paul Walker car crash. It’s sickening to hear how things like this occur. It makes me wonder what could have been done to prevent this crash from happening. air travel can be a little daunting. They need to find a way for future purposes to better air travel. It’s a very sad day for mamba and his daughter. ❤️Kobe\\'s strong work ethic to accomplish greatness will always be an inspiration for me to work hard on what I\\'m passionate about everyday. Never take life for granted because tomorrow isn\\'t promised.Rip Kobe and Gianna🙏🙏News: Kobe is dead.SAS: No, you are wrong and I\\'ll tell you why. This is the time where we desperately need SAS to prove them wrong...Coming from the NASCAR world, any time I see \"helicopter crash\" in a headline I immediately cringe.[removed]I\\'m not a basketball fan by any means, but I know who Kobe Bryant is. This is tragic. Fuck 2020.https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/> 4:30 PM PT -- L.A. weather was extremely foggy Sunday morning, and law enforcement sources tell us even LAPD air support was grounded because of it. Flight tracker data shows Kobe\\'s chopper appeared to first encounter weather issues as it was above the L.A. Zoo. It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear.> FLIGHT TOWER AUDIOWe know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA.At around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet.However, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 161 knotsIt is so unfortunate that inspite of having good health n wealth  a small accident can kill a whole legacyMy year is ruined 😥🙏🏿🙏🏿 my prayers to Kobe\\'s family, may he rest in power!https://www.instagram.com/p/B7zj9Ayg7pg/?igshid=1jvzauf39gklf[deleted]Anything about the other passengers?Kobe Bryant did what few people could. He’s not a hero. He’s not a legend. He’s an example. Examples aren’t forgotten, or require belief, they are given.He’s an example for dedication. An example for hard work. An example for competitiveness. An example for having the will to win.He left from close to where I live in orange county. So tragic :([deleted]no, mamba face was his game face. so idk why your trying to make this racial? here ya go douche bag https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fthesportsfanjournal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2FKobe-Bryant-black-mamba-getty-600x367.jpg&f=1&nofb=1All these fucking awards for a guy who linked the article? WhyRIP. Reminds me how precious and fragile life is. I\\'m especially sad about his daughter and family left behind.R.I.P, We All Will Miss You Kobe and GigiMet him once as a kid. Think there’s a recording somewhere. Dense fog in the hills. Gotta be content with being late sometimes.May their souls rest in peaceThe only comforting thing about this would be that as a father, he got to hold his daughter and comfort her before they passed. It\\'s a horrible thing to happen regardless and Kobe was one of those sports icons where you didn\\'t even have to watch the sport once to know who he was.God damn why doesn’t anybody care about mr peanuts deathNine people aboard what are the chances it was over loaded?So horrifying, sad, and shocking all at the same time. I can’t imagine what Kobe, his daughter, the pilot, and the other passengers felt during their final moments. I can’t fathom the amount of fear that rushed through their minds and bodies before the crash. How unfair life is sometimes.I would have hated to be the person who found/saw the bodies after the crash. What a sad, sad nightmare.>\"Melania and I send our warmest condolences\"Am not an expert in word usage but using warmest condolences doesn\\'t sound right. Any grammar experts on here?And then there Kobe he’s dead KB Kobe’s deadWhen I heard about it this morning I honestly thought \"that\\'s a lie\". And then when  it was all over Twitter, Facebook, and several news sites were reporting it, I knew it wasn\\'t a hoax. I\\'m still in shock. I\\'m sad for everyone involved.When Kobe was a kid he was constantly moving around the world with his dad and often didn\\'t speak the language of the country they were in.  One of the reasons he gravitated toward basketball was that no matter where he was all he had to do was go down to a court and he could communicate through the language of basketball.  I always thought that was really beautiful.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWm4a8nymY0&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWm4a8nymY0&feature=youtu.be)This cartoon from ages ago is getting censored on youtube. Seems really awful someone would make this. Terrible coincidence.Yep, there it goes again. It keeps getting put up. You all will have to find it for yourself.Y all the Reddit awards? It\\'s news.First big death of the decade.When I lived in L.A., whenever I was having a bad day or needed to clear my head, I’d run. I’d push open the shitty gate we had that didn’t really do much, take a left around the school and run up side streets parallel to Vermont Avenue, which was a pretty big street. I’d pass the ice cream trucks, caged roosters kept for cockfighting - smell the carne asada and weed that was coming from homes where people were playing dominoes in the garage. I’d cross under the bridge, the traffic and helicopters drowning out whatever I was listening to from my headphones. I’d hook a right on Washington, then left on Figueroa\\xa0\\xa0until I was at the Staples Center. That was Kobe’s house. When he was playing it was the heartbeat of that city. Every person in those streets, on every block, loved Kobe because of who he was and what he represented - a champion who transcended race, demanded excellence, and stood taller than any movie star - he was Los Angeles. This hurts, and that’s the best way to explain why it hurts to so many people from L.A. He represented the best of what everyone wanted to see in themselves - a drive, a mentality to win at any cost. This hurts.[removed][removed][removed]I don\\'t know a single person who hates Kobe. I really feel sad for his family, having to deal with not one but two deaths. When the Lakers win a championship this year it\\'s going to be special.Kobe, outbreak, war, 2020 continuing on with that bullshit of the 2010sMy favorite quote by Kobe was about mamba mentality “we don’t quit, we don’t cower, we don’t run. We endure and conquer.”  RIP MambaSaying KOBE before a shot will never be the sameWhy they gotta take the GOAT?!? RIPhis impact on court and off court will continue on forever. may him and his daughter rest in heavenly peace.What a magnificent athlete. You will be missed Kobe.You don’t have to like basketball to appreciate the work ethic of Kobe. He taught us passion for your respective craft and tedious conditioning for your weaknesses. Never stop becoming a better you. “Mamba mentality” lives on forever.[deleted]Can’t image how MJ is feelingI wonder what caused the crash.This is so sad, but even more so considering how everyone ignores the 7 other lives on board...What.What.What?!I’ve never even been into basketball and this still hits me like a truck. The man was a legend. May he Rest In Peace. May they all Rest In Peace.Kobe, you will be missed brother.Death comes for all of us manwhy does this effect any of us?is there any point at all in making this big of a deal over a retired basketball player.I\\'ve been crying for the last hour, Kobe was more than basketball for me, he was my idol and hero, he was what MJ was for him. Outside of MJ, I firmly believe Kobe is the greatest player the world has ever seen.His legacy, love life2020 really needs to chill. This was supposed to be our comeback. Rest easy Momba. Legends never really die.Life is just too short and nothing is ever promised to you. Carpe DiemWe lost a man who changed both the game of basketball, as well as the world, and his beautiful daughter today. RIP Kobe/GiannaOkay please tell me who gave this the ”Made Me Smile” awardI’ll just say that everybody pronounces his name like “Kobi” but if you ever want to discuss the Japanese city with his name, Kobe is pronounced “koh-beh.”Rip to you sir.RIP Kobe you were my hero from a young age. I always aspired to be like you. I will forever call out your name when shooting my shot whether on or off the court. May God bless your family in this trying time.[removed]Just wanted to leave here my condolences. I\\'m from Portugal, started following the NBA in 1990 and, because of that, became a Basketball coach, referee, club director, sponsor, mascot, and everything Basketball had to offer me. Kobe is a legend. Today, while working at Subway (yes, my connection to the USA came from sports and evolved for me having the longest opened Subway store in Portugal), someone told me \"Kobe died\". I was in shock. Tears came to my eyes when they told me Gianna was dead too. It shook me more than some family members, and it made me again open my eyes to life, family, love, and how we should just enjoy it all while it lasts. Kobe was a star. A big one. And he died, at his prime? At an age that one relaxes and just enjoys the results of working so damned hard? Doesn\\'t make sense...and it hit me. Hard. I cried thinking about my two daughters, and how I need to enjoy their presence while we\\'re all still here. Rest in peace Kobe, Gianna... Everyone, be peaceful, be happy. Love from Portugal.[Full transcript of Los Angeles Police & Fire Department press conference: Police share details on Kobe Bryant\\'s Death](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-los-angeles-officials-speak-about-kobe-bryants-death-in-press-briefing)I have watched this thread all day and it\\'s still not real.RIP Kobe Bryant Say hi to Muhammad Ali for us.I still can\\'t believe itWhy did this news post recieve so many awards? Serious question.Have an upvote.  I have no ill will to you.  If you are grieving, I\\'m sorry, I hope you find peace.This had me crying; I’m not a big basketball fan but just hearing about his death and his daughter was heart breaking. And knowing none of his daughters will be able to be walked down the aisle with him was a punch to my stomachHopefully it was not malfunctioning rotor head actuator(s) (= servos) this time... :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copterline_Flight_103If news details are correct, the copter than Bryant et al. where flying was Sikorsky S-76B, build in 1991. Copterline one that crashed in Finland (see above), was same model, but a newer version, S-76C, build in 2000.The key point is that copter model in question has a hydraulic servo design that can fail, if the actuator system is not maintained properly and inspected regularly. Which is something that copters manufacturer Sikorsky do not want to admit.For those interested in technical details:https://turvallisuustutkinta.fi/material/attachments/otkes/tutkintaselostukset/fi/ilmailuonnettomuuksientutkinta/2005/b42005l_tutkintaselostus/b42005l_tutkintaselostus.pdf[deleted]I don’t like basketball, but this is incredibly sad. A wife and children are going to bed tonight without their husband and father. I feel for them enormously.[deleted]A helicopter is a machine that violently thrusts air in a given direction, i remember reading a helicopter mechanic saying they would never ride in one due to the violent nature of how it functions.[removed]You just hate to see itSounds like he should have passed on that flight.That’s so incredibly sad.He legit just had another daughter like 3 months ago tooI can\\'t imagine how heartbreaking it must be to lose a daughter and husband in the same accidentAir Traffic Control with radar here https://youtu.be/B0pQfgi9ZqURIP Legend 🕊 🕊 🕊I think instead of saying “Kobe” when throwing our shots, we should say “For Kobe” to remember a legend.The Mavs just retired No. 24.My heart is so heavy right now. It doesn\\'t seem real that he is gone. I was a bartender when Kobe first came on the scene. We always had his games playing on the TV. He was magical from the very beginning.  Those of you that have never watched him play,  you should go on YouTube and get a taste of the masterpiece that he was. RIP, Kobe! Blessings to your family![removed]I\\'m shocked. I\\'ve lived in LA my entire life, and while basketball was always the one sport I could never get into, the Lakers were such a huge part of the city that one couldn\\'t help but love Kobe. Hell, when I would hear about Kobe Beef as a kid, I just assumed it was named after him. That\\'s what a huge deal he was.RIP to a legend. :(Not to distract from the topic at hand, but u/headee kinda got slammed with a bit of karma nglAm I the only one that finds it slightly disturbing how many awards posting about a person\\'s death gets?One of the best to ever do it. Rest In Peace Kobe and GiGi 🙏🏻wow, look at all those awards from someone’s death, fucking sadWe will always say Kobe when throw anything forever✊I still can’t fucking believe itStill waiting for someone to say sike.....I’d like  to know who awarded this post “made me smile” so that I can punch them in the faceThanks for those awesome memories on the court! RIP Black MambaOMG how I wish that\\'s fake news……still can\\'t believe it 💔💔💔Are there any helicopter pilots out there who can shed some light on what might have happened?Shocking & sad news, he was only 41! Always was a pleasure to watch him perform on the court & he seemed like a genuinely nice guy. In a way it seems this wouldn\\'t have happened if he didn\\'t use a helicopter to avoid traffic on the road but that doesn\\'t make his death any less sad. He was a family man & still had so much more to accomplish. Without doubt of the greatest, most hard-working basketball players of all time with one of the best personalities. RIPDoes anyone know the cause of the crash though?Technical error?Human error?Weather?We\\'re a spirit org at our University and we found out about this during a basketball game today. It completely passed over everyone\\'s heads when it was being played on the radio by the playcaller for those walking the concourse (not over the PA, none of the players/coaches found out until probably the second half, they took longer to come out of the locker rooms). Then it suddenly settled in. It was just, quiet.You could suddenly tell everyone was finding out when the entire arena went quiet and were only really cheering when we scored. One of our school\\'s alums was killed in it tooPeople who gave the timeless beauty award and made me smile award are just dicks.Dang, this is unfortunate. May the people in the helicopter rest in peace.Let’s not forget to pay respect to his daughter or anyone else on the helicopter for that matter everyone is important to someone.[deleted]RIP. I really wanted this to be a rumor. So sad it\\'s true.It was just an ordinary day for the Bryants. Life is unpredictableThis is absolutely surreal.I live near where this happened. I was awake last night and this morning; it was so foggy out here last night with a light drizzle, there\\'s no way I would of gone near a helicopter at any point last night. It was VERY bad. To all aboard RIPI don\\'t follow the NBA at all but even I had heard about Bryant and how much of a legend he is. To lose the daughter as well is heartbreaking for his family.And let\\'s not forget there were other victims as well.Have seen comments about helicopter safety. Here is some data from found. https://thepointsguy.com/news/are-helicopters-safe-how-they-stack-up-against-planes-cars-and-trains/I\\'m not a basketball fan at all but damn this was gut wrenching, especially his daughter. Hug your fam every damn day and tell them you love them.[removed][removed]To those bringing up the rape case:You just showed your hand.  If this is the thing you want to discuss at this moment, then go ahead.  But know that the rest of us now know what you people are made of, and what’s worse, you now know that you people are now capable of something this dark.  God help you in your lives when you have to look yourselves at the mirror and answer life’s toughest questions. And that at that moment you people will know that you cannot deny how dark and low you can go.Grow up.I have to say, I am really hating it when people are saying some variant of \"it won\\'t be the same yelling \\'Kobe\\' when shooting the ball/crumpled up piece of paper\". I doubt the intent is to be humorous, and everyone has their own way of grieving, but irritates me because it feels like a light-hearted comment.Fuck. I honestly thought it was April and a joke. I had to find multiple sources to confirm.  This is a tragedy.Why are there so many awards in this thread? Lmao, it\\'s like y\\'all are happyIt’s one thing to lose a husband... but to also lose a daughter... can’t even imagine. Rest in paradise and God bless VanessaWhy does this have a \"made me smile\" award???Still can’t believe itWho the fuck gave this a made me smile awardMy he and his daughter live in our hearts thru our memories. You will both be missed.Rest in piece ⚘Why do people give so many awards to posts like this?Such a great loss today. My heart goes out to the Bryant family as well as my condolences. You have brought much enjoyment into my to life watching you play, as well as much inspiration to many.  Thank you for your many accolades. May you and your angel rest peacefully now. <3RIP to an absolute LEGEND, and his daughterNews just said the official body count is 9 dead, not 5?In no way am I trying to put any disrespect towards Koby and his Daughter, but can we all take a moment for the other passengers that were onboard that helicopter too[removed]Why do people take out their credit cards and pay Reddit when a random user is the first to post some horrible news like this?I don\\'t even watch sports but I\\'m in shockI’m so devastated. I can’t do anything today. Last time I felt like this over a celebrity was Michael Jackson.I don\\'t follow the NBA much but this is insane. RIP.I don’t know why I can’t stop crying.  Still mad at that mofo for beating AI and the Sixers in the Finals.  I don’t know why I can’t stop crying.Rest in peace, Kobe, Gianna and all others.[deleted]I can’t believe the icon of my childhood is gone. I’m numb to this right now.What\\'s wrong with this year. It\\'s just endless bad news...... RIP Kobe. Life is short guys. Be happy and spend more time with your loved ones.[removed][deleted]I’ve never been a basketball fan and yet I can barely stop watching the news on this. (There’s also not a whole lot on TV otherwise...) I feel so sad for his wife and remaining children. Seems like he was an all-around amazing guy.[removed]I just got off a plane earlier, before we took off I said to myself \"I\\'ll never get used to flying\"Shit like this reaffirms why. My heart goes out to the families of everyone who passed.[I found this](https://youtu.be/B0pQfgi9ZqU), a video of the flight data when the crash happens. Very surreal.I still remember being a middle school kid and being in awe of how explosive and smooth he was on the court when he first came in the league. As I got older I’d watch Kobe play with a new appreciation for his work ethic. The man was an absolute work horse. Just the perfect combination of natural athleticism and a willingness to put in work. RIP, Kobe. Shed tears for you, your daughter and all on board today. What devastating news.I don’t really follow basketball but I am incredibly sad to hear about his and his daughters passing.

Rest In Peace, you will be missed.I\\'m not a huge basketball fan these days (we were a basketball family growing up) and regardless of whether or not you are a sports fan at all, Kobe Bryant was a luminary of American Athletics, and one of the best at what he did- ever. He was an important part of of the American Conversation on professional sports. Good or bad, Bryant was a phenomenal athlete and ambassador to the sport.  Of those lost, my real concern and empathic grief is for the loss of his daughter.  Kids are a sensitive issue, innocent and blessed by their potential.  It\\'s incredibly unfortunate (not to sound glib)- just plain sucks.  I found out an hour ago and still can\\'t believe it.He was a big part of my childhood. May him and his daughter rest in peace.Never followed the NBA nor did I know much about Kobe, but for some reason I’m having feelings as if it was someone I worshiped and loved. RIP Kobe, his daughter and others that perished.That\\'s why I drive a carHelicopters are death trapsI met Jose Fernandez 2 days before he died. I never thought a celebrity death could affect me as much as that, but here we are.So incredibly sad. There will never be another athlete like Kobe. RIPI have two found memories of Kobe Bryant. The first was a personal encounter that occurred ages ago. I was with my uncle at South Coast Plaza in Santa Ana, CA. My uncle and I were on the 2nd floor sitting at one of the tables at Antonello Espresso Bar.  As we’re sitting there, we see Kobe walking towards us. He was with his two daughters.My uncle looks at me and says “Kobe speaks Italian; watch this!”In Italian, my uncle yells out to Kobe,“Kobe! Want a cup of espresso?Kobe smiles kind of laughs and politely responds in Italian “no thank you I’m with my children!” It was cool.[removed]RIP King       O       B       EDoes anyone have a link to Kobe\\'s rep(s) confirming the passing?

Honestly, no joke. I am not in the least a fan of the NBA, but you at least have to acknowledge this abrupt and saddening loss of life. Rest in eternal peace to all on that heli.Wow, that\\'s insane.I was never into basketball but still recognised his talent. RIP to him and the pilot, plus the others on board.[removed]So surreal.

I can\\'t even begin to imagine being in a scenario like Kobe trying to console his daughter during those final moments.[removed]RIP sir, may God give  your family strength and strength to everyone else whose loved ones perished in this tragedy.Kobe was more than just a basketball player...he was a cultural icon, an Academy Award Winner, a role model, and most importantly, a husband and a father. And to make matters worse, his 13 year old daughter was also killed in the crash. The events that transpired today are truly tragic; this has got to be one of the saddest days in sports history. My heart is so heavy right now. RIP KOBE AND GIANNAI hated him as a player and was never a fan.However, this news makes me very sad. Tragic that his daughter passed as well.Very heart breaking news.RIP KobeFrom TMZ“The Mayor of Costa Mesa, Katrina Foley, just confirmed the identity of one of the other victims in the helicopter crash ... girls basketball coach Christina Mauser, who\\'s married to Tijuana Dogs singer Matt Mauser. Matt also confirmed the news himself.”:(I\\'m really curious, was there no parachute on the helicopter?Missed by many. Loved by many.

Sincere condolences to the families!Worst day in basketball history.The world has lost a legend today! Fuck 2020.I find it incredible that I have been scrolling for 15 minutes, and there is not a single mention of the 7 other human beings killed in this crash. My condolences to ALL of the families that have been so impacted by this tragedy.  He may have been a great basketball player, but his life is worth no more or less than every other human being killed in that crash.TMZ reports they flew over the LA Zoo in circles for several minutes at low altitude hoping that the fog would clear.  They then began to fly away and were rising but did not clear the mountains.  :([removed]*pours out drink for lost homies**tosses bottle into recycling bin*“Kobe”😭[removed]Bloody sucks I was so hoping this was fakePlausible cause of crash.

I didn’t want to believe it, I can’t imagine the pain the family is going through, especially the mother to lose her baby girl and husband. RIP Gianna and Kobe, you will be missed. I pray for the family🙏🏾💔Heroes come and go, but *Kobe* is forever[removed]Please remember the 2 remaining Altobelli children. Their mother, father, and sister all apparently died in crash With Kobe and his daughter. 😔As a Basketball Fan, this feels like losing someone you knew personally. Brings me to tears.This 2020 is something special...Remember to sort by controversial!This sounds too much like what happened to Colin McRae. Rip to a great sportsman and philanthropist[removed]We lost a legend, way too soon :,([removed]I just can’t believe it.Imagine losing your husband only to find out your daughter was killed as-well. Heartbreaking, much love to the family.#what the fuck 2020Give us a fucking break, goddamn this is heartbreakingGrew up with Kobe... I remember playing his N64 game for hours. God rest his and his daughter\\'s soul and may God watch over his family.Don’t realize how remembered someone will be until you use his name every time you land a sick nade, or a nice hoopAnother death to remember on my birthday.I never liked basketball, never really even sat down to watch a single game but Kobe had always been there during my childhood as sort of a role model cause he was a great dude and these news are just heartbreaking for me. I can\\'t even imagine for the millions of fans, friends and family. What a sad day.Dude was my idol growing up, an absolute competitive beast. I can\\'t believe it, RIP.This is tragic and random.Who else died in the crash?Why does this have \\'made me smile\\' awardAm I the only who finds it weird upvoting someone fucking dying?Just feels strangePersonally, this whole tragedy is a grim reminder on the fragility of lifeI was Kobe hater growing up. One thing I couldnt deny- he was a helluva athelete. My heart is broken for him. He is among the GOATS at the game. Rip Kobe.[removed]This thread makes me hate some of my fellow humansFucking unreal. Still can’t believe the headline.Holy shit...I don’t even follow sports but this is shocking. So sorry mate, rest well.Thanks for all the memories you brought to us Lakers fans in Los Angeles. I remember the first year you were a rookie to the last year wearing that Lakers uniform, bringing us 5 championships during the ride. Rest In PeaceJust bouncing off some talking points, but what makes helicopters so dangerous compared to other modes of transportation? I read an article about a very experienced pilot that died due to a helicopter accident, but he had little to no safety training and the helicopter had a plastic fuel tank that ruptured upon landing. I know there are statistics, but why are helicopters considered more dangerous than other transportation if you do account for the pilot being well trained?Tragic, say what you will about the man but you can not dispute the fact he was an inspiration for so many kids growing up and brought a competitive nature to his work ethic that we hadn’t seen since Jordan.I still remember the first basketball game I watched, I instantly loved Kobe as a player and I still do. RIP Kobe you were an idol for many basketball fans and players.[deleted]Sounds like human error, the pilot likely went straight into the mountains due to fog:4:30 PM PT -- L.A. weather was extremely foggy Sunday morning, and law enforcement sources tell us even LAPD air support was grounded because of it. Flight tracker data shows Kobe\\'s chopper appeared to first encounter weather issues as it was above the L.A. Zoo. It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear.We know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA.At around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet.However, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 161 knots.[removed]Wow and only one month into 2020. I don\\'t watch basketball but I know Kobe meant a lot to many people, rest in peace.Does anybody know details as to why the helicopter went down and the others who perished? This is so tragic and so sudden, but I wonder who else was in that helicopter. I know he was taking his daughter to basketball practice based off other comments so I’m wondering if people in there were friends of Kobe or friends of his daughter even, or as to why it’d go down, very crazy and unexpected, prayers to all families who lost someone and those affected by the loss of an NBA legend.[removed]Jaystation’s gonna have a good time with this oneFeel so sorry for his daughter, she literally had her whole life ahead of her. RIP to all of those lost in this tragic event.I\\'m not a Lakers fan, but Kobe\\'s death has hit me harder than any other celebrity ever. Growing up and even now, Kobe was the epitome of hard work, tenacity, competitiveness, and dedication to one\\'s craft. To have that person die is just so disheartening because it seemed like it could never happen due to what he represented to me. There\\'s a reason the phrase \"Mamba Mentality\" exists. RIP[removed][deleted]China is just waking up to this now.Very sad for the whole world.Please Shaq....shazam kobe back to life.[deleted]heartbreaking. kobe was the reason i loved basketball. through watching him play and listening to his philosophies i have learned so much. kobe was more than basketball and you could see that through him and his daughters relationship. RIP to a legend and one in the making ❤️🏀RIP, Rest In Heaven KobeGone at least a half century too soon. And his daughter even more. Incredibly sad day.[removed]I’m not a fan of basketball but my sister taught me at a very young age to yell “KOBE” when shooting something in the trash. RIP to a legend, his daughter and everyone else on that helicopter.Alot of people had beef from him so it probably wasn\\'t an accident[removed]9 people on board now?Mad respect and heart felt sadness of the loss coming from a big Spurs fan.  What an experience to have watched Lakers battle the Spurs for the 2000 decade.Why are there articles online saying this is a hoax?Damn i didn’t know that thank youNot only did they crash, the helicopter exploded. I can\\'t imagine the pain they felt stuck in the rubble in those flames. Hopefully they passed instantly.Here is his final flight: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n72ex#23a8271eEdit: FlightAware: https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N72EXTo live and die in LA...Some of these awards for OPs post are confusing and potentially disturbing. Like really? The clapping award? Wtf we clapping about?I never met Kobe but I idolized him. He was one of my hero’s. Watched him from a little kid to man now. For 20 years I watched and idolized him. Can’t stop crying. I can’t imagine how his family feels.. Praying for them..Rip to the greatest of all time, rip to his beautiful daughter. Hope their souls are together, comforting each other.It\\'s so mad. You can have it all and poof... GoneJust left downtown Los Angeles near the staples center. Thousands are heading down to staples center to celebrate the legend.Edit: if I didn’t have to hit the airport the fiancé and I would absolutely be there.Kobe you were an idol and a role model to so many.  You will be truly missed.  Thank you for the memories and everything you’ve done in basketball and outside.They\\'re now reporting his 17 year old daughter was on board too. This story just keeps getting worseEdit. My wife is apparently fake news. She was sitting next to me asking if I\\'d seen that his oldest daughter died too. I didn\\'t verify it and I should have. I asked her where she got that from and it was a fucking Facebook clickbait scam. I apologize for being a clownI\\'m leaving my comment as a reminder of the time I spread fake newsWhat\\'s even dumber is that the story got wrong that his daughter got help for an apparent asthma attack or panic attack, idk they can\\'t even get that right.Does killed imply intent?Didn\\'t he rape a woman?Very sad... May God grant him heaven.Kobe didn’t just have one daughter but 4; his wife is preg rn with the fourth and he and one daughter sadly left them today...It’s a very intense day for the Bryant family. May they find peace and comfort in all of the chaos today brought them. That they are loved and he will be remembered as the wonderful Man, father and basketball player that he is/was.Edit: the 4th daughter might of actually been born alreadyShhhh, I\\'m not supposed to say anything bad about basketball on here.[removed]Only reason we hear about aircraft crashes is because of how rare it is. Imagine for a second if we heard about every car crash or hell just every fatal car crash everytime. Not counting celebs.I see a car crash everyday on my way to work.[removed]RIP to an absolute legend to the game of basketball and his beautiful and talented young daughter. I hope that their last moments weren’t filled with fear and that they didn’t suffer. Also, I hope Vanessa and his other 3 daughters are being surrounded by their loved ones right now. I can’t imagine what it’s like to lose a husband, daughter, father and sister all at once and how hard it is to continue on. I can’t believe that this is real.. feels like a really bad dreamA huge part of my childhood. RIP Kobe and Gigi. I hope you are in a better place. Thank you for making my childhood so entertaining.This news sucks. Gone too soon!When you get so rich and famous that your commute can kill you, crazy. His poor wife.I dont even follow Basketball but everyone know\\'s who he is. I can\\'t even imagine the heartbreak for his wife and family.This death hurts so much.May his family have peace knowing so many people cared about him[removed]Yeet for distanceKobe for accuracyAs a father I am crushed to hear that he and his 13 year old daughter died.RIP to the Legend and all of the victims.Wonder what kind of loser downvoted this 🤷\\u200d♂️Rest in Piece to an absolute Legend.Hopefully like that story \"Divided by infinity\" there is another reality where those on board are safe.[removed][removed][removed]I\\'ve never really been into sports all that much, but this sucks.Anyone else notice there\\'s a lot of young(ish) celebrities dying recently?RIP Mamba. You were a true legend. The daughter though. Man it\\'s hard not to be heartbroken even if you aren\\'t a fan.I can’t imagine how Kobe felt as the helicopter was going down with his baby girl next to him. My heart hurts. 😭Goodbye Kobe, it\\'s been nice.hope you found your, paradiseeeeThis is the first incident where I will always always remember where I was when it happened.Apparently there was a rotor failure, which caused the crash.This is enough reddit for me today.Dont feel good to hear about this news. R.I.P Kobe and GiannaI thought it was fake at first. :( so sad.[removed]I like to believe that in the final seconds, Kobe wrapped himself around his daughter in hopes to save her.I´m so fucking gutted, rest in peace legend.[deleted]How horrifying. He was an amazing athlete and legend to the game. I always chose the Lakers in the 2K games because of his crazy stats. Can’t believe it...Feel free to pay respects to Kobe and his daughter but please also be respectful of the 7 other victims. Their families are mourning too.[deleted]I just flew from LAX to Boston on Alaska. Flight took off at 10:01 AM, and there was no wifi available on the flight for some reason. People literally gasped as we landed 15 minutes ago, and the push notifications began coming in. \"My boy Kobe!\" Someone a few rows down from me exclaimed.[removed]Damn that\\'s right by the Joe Roagan\\'s studio and house, Whitney Cummings too.This is tragic but even worse when children are involved :-(The really awful thing is how terrified they all must have been right before the crash.Super sad.  A legend has died.Why would someone give this a “made me smile award” ?[removed][deleted]Rest in peace to those 8 other people on the helicopter with himHelicopters gonna heli...I hate to think this but have we, the news, Twitter, who ever, heard from his wife or other family? Has anyone been able to confirm that his wife is alive? No news stations have indicated that she is alive.  Now that there are nine gone... that could be his wife and other kids.Kobe wasn’t just a model for people who loved sports, he was model for everyone who wanted to work as hard as he did. One of if not the most hardworking man to ever live. Kobe will never be forgotten and neither will his daughter. The black mambas legacy will live on forever! RIP KobeCannot believe this. Worst news ever.Rest in peace and condolences everyone involved.I was devasted when I heard this. And his child too? This is terrible, may they both be resting in peace.So like what was wrong with the helicopter did they state anythingFfs, can January 2020 just ***chill*** for a sec?4 hours I\\'ve been watching news. I don\\'t think I\\'ve taken a death by someone I\\'ve never met before so hard. So many memories growing up, such an example now as a family man. I miss him playing and I miss being happy for and about him in retirement.I didn’t realize this would hit me hard. But his daughter too, and all the others in the crash. Ive been yelling KOBE every time I throw any object for last decade. Fuck.What a fucking shame for KobeThis will probably get lost but here goes nothing. I was never much of a basketball fan, but I respected the hell out of Kobe. I just read a message, in part, \"Kobe Bryant killed...\". I mind just stopped because of the shock value. I guess it never dawned on me that he would die this soon. After reading the comments about his daughter here, I almost feel worse for her because no innocent 13 (or however old she was) deserves to die.Could be the pilot lost visual in the clouds.  Rather than ascend and establish instrument awareness, he chose to descend to reestablish visual, at too rapid of a pace and slammed into a hill.  The helicopter was dual engine, so bar mechanical failure of both engines, it would maintain altitude.  Just tragic all around.  I will think of all the victim\\'s families during this tragedy.I was shocked when I heard of this on television because it had hit me harder than it should have. May he and the 9 other people who were killed rest in peace.I don’t think flying around in a helicopter near the mountains in the fog was such a good idea.RIP black mamba. You were taken too early and still had a lot to give back to the world. Love the NBA, not a Lakers fan, but he is a top three player and did a lot for the sport.[deleted]Wow. Forever a legend.This is fucking surreal, I just watched him congratulate LeBron. This is unreal.This is one of those deaths where a year from now, some stand-up comedian is gonna try to make a joke about Kobe’s death and the audience is gonna boo the hell out of that person2020 is just absolute trash so far[deleted]When my parents told me this, I thought it would be a good article for r/atetheonion because I thought the article was fake:([deleted]His plans were to big for this world, shame that life removes those with the greatest ambition for the betterment of others[removed]Now news is saying wife and daughter are deadincredibly sad. God bless their soul.As I understand it, helicopters are able to auto rotate in the event of an engine failure, meaning you at least can slow your descent to something that won\\'t kill you. Can anyone speculate on how this type of thing happens?I was never a basketball fan nor a sports fan in general. I only really knew of Kobe Bryant from the occasional Kobe memes that would pop in my timeline and media attention him and his family got, but this. This is beyond tragic. To lose a daughter and a husband, I can’t even begin to fathom the monolithic amounts of pain Vanessa is experiencing right now. May they both Rest In Peace eternally. Just another reminder of how fragile life is and how it can all end with just the snap of a finger.This cartoon eerily predicted this 2 years agohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elXuUwOoBEoAnd his 13 year old daughter they upped the victims to 6.I\\'m never getting in a fucking helicopterWow. Just wow. When superstars pass early its always a solemn reminder of your pwn mortalityI’m not going to pretend i was Kobe’s biggest fan , but when I heard the news I was still shock. Such a tragic thing to happen and I feel so bad for his family.Sports are inherently divisive. 90% of NBA fans *couldnt stand* Kobe Bryant in the late ‘90s-00’s (myself included as a Suns fan), but 100% of us stand here today, stunned and saddened, because he was a **legend.**It\\'s just shows how precious life is. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone. So scary and sad. I just want to reach out to my family and say that I care ❤️😢☹️[removed]Rest in peace, legend.RIP, a true goat of basketball[deleted]Dang. I never really watched basketball, but it must suck knowing your favorite player has died. He even died with his daughter, too. He made great plays in his NBA career. Rest In Peace.Magic  out living everyoneThis is just horrific his 13 year old daughter tooWith 9 other people along with his 13 year old daughter it\\'s a fucking sad day not going to lieMan, do I feel for his family. When I was 17, I lost my father and two sisters in a plane accident. I wouldn’t wish going through that on my worst enemy.I never liked Kobe as a player on the opposition team. You were never safe when Kobe was on the floor. I hated him, then the stuff in Colorado came out and I hated him even more. Somewhere along the way though, either I matured or he just became a different person and I liked him. Then the movie came out and it made me understand him a bit more and I started liking him more. After his retirement, I felt he became more gracious, more focused on his family and that made me love him. This just puts me to tears. A big loss, whether you liked him or hated him. This. Is. A. Huge. Loss.  Be nice to each other, don’t use harsh words, never know when they will be your last. Be humble and just pay it forward while you can. Long love the mamba and his legacy. May god give his family the strength in these trying times and help them to get thru this and carry his legacy. Love you brother. Your smile and competitiveness will be missed.Oh my God this was not the news I was expecting to hear today[deleted]He shooting hoops with Jesus now.[deleted]Wow saying nothing about the man himself, but he was a hell of a player. RIP[removed]Man I wish they had just gotten an Uber instead of the helicopter, so sad, poor girl she was only 13! 😞Chamberlin heights cartoon showI really hope im wrong in my assumption that the other passengers were all teammates of his daughter\\'s basketball practice. Having 7 kids die would be even worse.[removed]Wish I was in the multiverse where he’s still alive.That’s a goddamn tragedyRIP to everyone lost in this horrible tragedy.  Love goes out to the families of the victims.  Lost a legend in 24 no other way to put it.They could be talking about Ontario, CaliforniaThis is very surreal. I still can\\'t believe it.person on the news compared Kobe’s tragic death with Magic Johnson’s HIV diagnosis. weird.I was at work when I heard the news. I didn’t say anything until local news corroborated the incident. People did not believe me until I showed them the need headlines. Kobe was a staple of my childhood. He was an amazing guy and will live forever in our hearts.Sometimes you don\\'t realise people are a part of your life until they\\'re gone.People in here probably never met Kobe or been in his vicinity ever in their life, but his accolades and his accomplishments have been an inspiration.You grow up hearing kobes name or seen his image throughout years of your life and he may be associated with moments in your life you didn\\'t expect it to until this happens and it triggers all those emotions.As a poster from the UK where basketball isn\\'t as big,  I\\'ve always looked to Kobe and thought wow...this guy\\'s special. I\\'ve seen Jordan be the guy and then seeing Kobe carry that torch until symbolically last night where he acknowledged LeBron surpassing him in the all time list. A lot of great sportsman outside basketball look up to Kobe. The guy even won an Oscar??!?!? How many people can do what this guy did?On top of that, as someone who is going through a time in my life where I\\'m heavily questioning my mortality and seeing someone who seemed almost invincible, living a life someone would dream of with admiration from fans for something that they loved doing really hit me.From a sporting legend, to a loving and supportive father. Two things I always wanted to be growing up. Hopefully I can still achieve the latter.RIP Kobe & Gianna Bryant. RIP to the other unnamed members on that helicopter and condolences to them and those who hold them dearly.This is incredibly sad. This guy gave his all for basketball and his wife had to endure and support behind the scenes while he was playing on away games, travelling overseas to promote basketball, and summer training. Just as he retired and accustomed to life at home and they both get to enjoy this for a few years, this happens. So incredibly sad. He worked so incredibly hard on his game and craft for 20 straight years. Sad day for the world.Crazy, helicopter crash was an hour away from where I live, and maybe 15 mins from where I work.My heart is heavy mourning the loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter. He is a legend, and legends never die.Something big is still to be announced so sadSo sad! he’ll be missed[removed]My favorite player after Mike. RIP KOBE.  Loved how you did it!!I don\\'t even follow basketball and I feel the impact of this. RIP Kobe & Gianna.[deleted]I can not imagine what Vanessa, his wife is going through right now.  Just completely heartbreaking.  I hope people give them the space and respect they need to grieve their way & their timeline.  And that goes to the family and friends of everyone who died in the accident. Unless he played against the Bulls, I didn’t/don’t really watch Lakers game often. But I’ll definitely be watching on Tuesday as they play against The Clippers.  I got to see him play in 2005. Ronald McDonald House was gifted tickets to a game.  We were able to take the tickets. What I didn’t know , it was floor seats.  I was feet away watching Kobe play. And even though he played against us... you still watched him no matter what.  I’m glad he is a part of my memory of that incredible experience I had to watch the game on the court.  This is just heartbreaking.I still can not believe this. I grew up watching him play and now I\\'ll never see him again. RIP 8This is devastating. I’m not going to pretend I’m into the NBA or basketball as a sport, but I was a huge fan of his motivational speeches that he would do. What a legend. Still in awe of the breaking news. No words cannot express how his wife must be doing.This gives me, Michael Jackson and Tupac vibesHelicopters are notoriously dangerous. With as much as he used that one, the odds were piling up.  His helicopter was nearly 30 years old.Please don’t forget there is an impeachment trial going on...This being so sudden is what makes it hurt so much. Someone who we grew up with and was just always there in the public eye suddenly gone. It\\'s so sad.Damn. This is just incredibly tragic. RIP Kobe Bryant.RIPMy condolences to his family and all the other families that\\'s lost someone in this tragedy.My thoughts are with his familyr/helicopter has two different comment posts discussing Kobe Bryant’s flight path, the weather, his helicopter.  If it soothes anyone to know what people familiar with helicopters are trying to figure out, here’s the link for one. r/helicopters KobeBryant what maybe happened r/helicopters second discussion link* r/helicopters or r/aviationmaintenance might have more to say now. There may be subreddits for private pilots, pilots...I wonder what caused the crash? From what I remember this is a pretty routine thing for Kobe to take his private helicopter around LA to avoid trafficI can\\'t believe it\\'s true. I am still shocked by the news. Rest in peace Legend. You\\'ll remain in our hearts forever.Who were the other seven people. It\\'s like this article doesn\\'t give two shits about those folks. They aren\\'t rich or famous.[removed]That\\'s just shockingly sad, 2020 is definitely not a good year.I’m not even that big a fan of basketball, yet hearing about his loss really shook me up. He was only in his forties and both him and his teenage daughter are gone just like that. My heart aches for his wife, the other daughters and the rest of his family. I hope and pray they’ll be able to pull through such a sudden tragedy. May all those in the crash Rest In Peace.Rest In Peace to Kobe and GiGiThis is just awful. I\\'m normally quick to crack a joke but even I can feel all the sadness pouring into this death, and I\\'m not even a sports kind of guy.Ofcourse it started a forest fire.  Never change, California.This thread is fucking toxic. You all have had 17 years to try to burn this man and you all decide the day of his death is the day to do it? Many of us love the Kobe on the court, none of us knew the Kobe off the court. Get off your fucking high horses[deleted]What was the cause of the crash??? Who is responsible???This is tragic, someone is to blame. Helicopters dont just fall out of the sky.Rest in peace. This is so sad and devastating.Does anyone know why the chopper went down?A heartbreaking tragedy 💔🙏🏼https://twitter.com/chrisjacksonsc/status/1221528786505740290?s=21Kobe is one of those people you never thought would die.I really hope it was mid-air explosion or something quick. It might be my opinion but I wouldn’t want to be in aircraft accident and be alive as it plummeted down to the ground to then kill me. God, Rest In Peace  Kobe and GiGi and the rest of the victims2020 is fucking cursedI wasn\\'t even the biggest Kobe fan, but this news made me physically sick and heartbroken. He was an amazing basketball player of course, but he seemed like an even better father. Idk how his wife, or anyone for that matter, could deal with losing not only her husband and best friend, but their daughter too. I\\'m probably rambling because I can\\'t really parse this right now. I just hope and pray for Kobe\\'s wife Vanessa and the rest of his family and friends.This news instantly made me think of JFK Jr\\'s death from a helicopter crash. I\\'m sure that shows my age, so idk if most people on here will remember it. But anyway, private helicopters scare the shit out of me.[removed]Rest in Peace. This is so saddening to read, it\\'s horrible and scary how stuff like this can happen at any time to anyone. Heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers go out to their family and friends.I actually still can’t fucking believe this.it seems like it was a 20minute drive. why did they use a helicopter?https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confessionI feel bad for the other 7 people who are  being mentioned as afterthoughts because they aren\\'t famousI\\'m sorry for his family, and the loss of his daughter is unbelievably tragic. But I\\'m not going to mourn Kobe, nor laud his accomplishments. Being good at basketball doesn\\'t make you a good person, nor does it erase the fact that he was a rapist.Absolutely a tragedyThis crash took 9 liveshttps://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Still can’t believe this.pro tip: do not casually travel by helicopter even if it\\'s within your means. it is very unsafe.I\\'ve just got to say, 2020 has started out to be really bad so far.How is anyone celebrating Kobe dying?  Must be assholes and salty LeBron fans.[removed]For what it\\'s worth, based on what I\\'ve seen from the crash scene, it\\'s likely none of them ever felt a thing. :(Also some bs is that he took a helicopter to avoid like 20-30 minutes of traffic. This shit is getting ridiculous in Los Angeles not only the traffic and saturation but the inequality and wasteful usage of fossil fuels!!!My heart breaks for the families involved. Growing up in SoCal he was a big part of all of our lives and community.  Such a sad day.[deleted]We need to stop Bill Burr from ever traveling by helicopter again.What a great start to 2020. It\\'s just January and we already have Coronavirus issues, bushfires, volcanic eruptions, now Kobe is dead.Weather or not you like Kobe this is absolutely horrible. Rest in peace to him and his very young daughter.[removed]Was never a true sports fans, but grew up watching and hearing about Kobe and Shaq duo. Touched my heart still when he decided to retire and all the time he showed such grace and leadership in whatever he did. despite his past personal history, he seemed to be a great parent as well. even though i\\'m not into sports, i\\'m crying. condolences to his family. this is utterly just devastating. wish it was fake news for once.Reports are now saying 9 in total died, 8 passengers and the pilot.  This is tragic.My heart breaks for the family. To lose your father and a sibling or your husband and your child must be among the worst experiences one can live through. I can\\'t even imagine.I was really looking forward to the future and seeing how far his daughter might go in raising the profile and image of women\\'s basketball.I don’t want to believe this.*Sorts by controversial*I just finished watching the Muse and the end date for the last scene is January 26, 2015. It seems so eerie watching that last scene as he’s traveling in the helicopter. So sad for Kobe, his talented daughter, family and the people effected as well. RIP Kobe[deleted]Rest easy Kobe. A true legend.Very sad, Kobe as been into my work a few times with his daughters and they were always very kind. RIP2020 so far:Baghdad airport getting spicyThreat of a third world warTrump is still POTUSPlague Inc: China EditionBasketball great diesCmon man it\\'s only JanuaryThat is so sad, the man worked hard and couldn’t even enjoys his kids grow fully. RIP Kobe. Edit: The daughter too, that is heartbreaking, need more details from the investigation.What a crap way to start the morning here in Australia.  Let\\'s see if they can pin down the cause of the crash.Why did 121k people like this? This is horrible...Ridiculous that forged and inaccurate video recordings of the crash are being posted on his Twitter page. People are posting a helicopter crash from Dubai in 2018 to mislead others.Complete silence for 24 seconds in the raptors/ pelicans. Wow[deleted]And the worst part of it all?  The hypocrisy!It\\'s a pity he couldn\\'t dunk his way out of this one :\\'(RIP IN PEACE KOBESo sad! Thank you for so many great memories, may you RIP.Damn, it really just proves how many people know without even knowing the sport. Whether you play basketball or don’t, love it or hate it, you knew or heard the name kobe bryant. Just proves how much of an effect he had on not just the sport but the whole world.RIP Kobe BryantFucking, stupid, fucking, fucking bullshit.Matt Mauser (of Tijuana Dogs band) lost his wife in Kobe Bryant crash.This is so sad. I didn\\'t know him. I know what he represented. He gave his life to basketball. This was his time to spend with the family. To see his kids grow up.I can not help but think of Colin McRae, who was of similar age and died in a helicopter crash along with both of his sons. Very sad and tragic.He was still too young to die.What the fuckJust so surreal. As a young kid growing up in LA playing basketball idolizing the player that he was and what he did for our city and the game of basketball. Maturing as a man and idolizing the examples he set off the court on what is is to be a man, husband, father, brother, son. The impact you left on us on and off the court will forever live on. Love you, RIPUnbelievable and shocking. He was an outstanding player for some of NBA\\'s greatest championship teams. My condolences goes out to Kobe\\'s family, friends, and loved ones.Kobe was an unquestionably great basketball player.  That won’t be the only legacy he will leave behind.I\\'m watching dog training videos because my wife and I have to make a decision on adopting one today/tonight. In one video a dog is named \"Kobe\".  I thought \"hmm.. yeah, probably a gazillion dogs named \"Kobe\", and \"Jordan\", \"Shaq\", etc..\". Close that out, scroll around on YouTube, watch a video and see LeBron passed him on the scoring list.  \"Huh, coincidence\" I thought. Walk in here to my desk, pull up Reddit, and... yeah.  Weird. Frak.  2020 has been really sucking so far, and this isn\\'t helping.  R.I.P.I don’t care about anything basketball but this tears my heart apart so much 😔I remember whenever I would go traveling out of LA and then coming back to LAX and always seeing the ad with a photo of Kobe and something along the lines of \"welcome to LA\".. they took it down after he retired but that always made me feel happy to be back in Cali RIP Kobe BryantFYI I know how bad it is to capitalize on his death right now but there is an option to donate all or even a percentage of your ebay proceeds when you list an item. So if you are going to capitalize on his death at least give back to the charity he loved. People are selling his stuff for outrageous amounts of money right now. You can select the Kobe & Vanessa Family Foundation as part of the list of charities. You can also directly donate at kvbff.org.Just pay attention to how much more bothered people are by a sports idol dying compared to [Epstein](https://i.imgur.com/xmXBuih.png), who had ties to US presidents and politicians. No disrespect to Kobe, but c\\'mon.Edit: And Bryant was a rapist! I forgot all about that. Y\\'all people are fucked in the head.I had read about Kobes death 2 hours ago, and been thinking of it for past 1 hour or so and just when i thought it couldn\\'t get more brutal it turns out his daughter was in the helicopter too, shouldn\\'t have touched the mobile again before going to bed.. now i can\\'t sleep.RIP Kobe you were and always will be legend![removed]I hope LeBron goes on a rampage this year and gets the chip, and dedicate it to Kobe. Mamba Forever!!!It seems almost unrealI can’t even imagine how awful and frightening this must have been. May him and his daughter Rest In Peace... His poor, poor family must be taking this incredibly hard.[removed]Why do rich people still use helicopters? Soooo many of them have died in helicopter crashes! Here in the UK there was one not too long ago in which the owner of ~~I believe Man United~~ Leicester City died.Edit: correctedI woke up to this news. I was hoping it was a dream. I always joked how LeBron was better than Kobe but always knew Kobe was one of the best ever. This is gut-wrenching and soul-crushing.This is fucked. Just yesterday he\\'s posting a congratulatory message to LeBron about passing him on the scoring list, today him and his daughter are gone.   I\\'m only 26, but my Dad had me watching Laker games since before I could talk, this man was the reason I was so into the NBA and played basketball through highschool. The world will not be the same now that he\\'s no longer in it.   R.I.Paradise Kobe \"Black Mamba\" Bryant and Gianna Bryant.My mother was shocked.She\\'s a 60 year old Chinese lady who never watched basketball. That\\'s how much of a household name he is.Apparently 9 lives are lost from today’s helicopter crash 😥😥😥https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Truly a heartbreaking day. I’m a sixers fan and huge Allen iverson fan. As a kid I hated Kobe, because he was so good. As I grew up and he also grew up I respected him and rooted for him. He’s more than a basketball player. He’s a hero.  RIP 24, basketball will never be the same without you here. Prayers to the other family in this horrible tragedy as well, and also to GigiThis just adds to all the crazy things that have happened this year. So many unbelievable events have taken place, and this is definitely a sad one. Everyone will miss this man.[removed]Thats really sad. Im sorry for to thr families that suffered these losses. Tragedy can strike at any time.This is such a sad day for Kobe’s wife. To lose her husband and daughter at the same time, RIP. Both super bowl teams played well for him and we got a great halftime showI just checked his Instagram page and he appeared to be very close to Gigi because she played basketball at the Mamba Academy and he coached her along the way.There are so many posts of her playing and it’s crazy to think that there will be no more of that. She was just 13, my God.Also, the pictures with the rest of his daughters, particularly the 3-year-old and the 6-month-old are absolutely heartbreaking, given that they will grow up with zero memories of him.Life changes in an instant...hug your loved ones tightFor all those speculating - the [speed and alt are already known] (https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/).It looks like the pilot was flying to low and too fast in foggy weather conditions.  Educated guess from the data is the pilot was not IFR and flew it into a hill and didn\\'t realize it until the last minute (jump up in speed and alt.)My heart breaks for all the lives lost in the crash not only Kobe’s and his daughters, but everyone on board and their families.Damn this is crazy. Makes his send off commercial from Nike way more sadBet everyone circlejerking about the rape allegation 17 years ago feel REAL good up on your moral high horse after destroying a dead man with that comment. Got anything to say about his kid as well? Or his now fatherless 4 kids or widow? No?man, i just woke up..what the fuck, good lord.Not saying this person did but a lot of people posted all about this. Some people just want awards on reddit.The all star game teams should wear all #8 and all #24 respectively.Anyone that wants to ride on a helicopter would probably change there minds now.more proof that god does not exist.if there is a god, I can\\'t imagine why children have to die as a result of accidents, murders, diseases, wars, etc...This is incredibly sad !Oh man. That\\'s a heartbreaking moment. Peace to their family!Someone out there are using this news to sell his shoes at an insane markup...Aside from that, I want to see the cause of the crashFor a moment i thought this was a fake news. Holy shit!This is so sad. They were so young.did he win any olympic medal?Wow. I’m shocked. I guess you never know when your time has come.Holy shit I dont even watch basketball but this is a tragedy.  2020 definitely got 2019 beat in bullshit in one single fucking month.Helicopters are just death traps when you think about it. There’s no way to glide like planes if there’s anything wrong. Just a flimsy piece of metal spinning at high rate keeping you above falling. You only hear about the rich dying in them. RIP to the legendI dont know him but I feel sorry. Rip kobeIts now 9 killed in the crash. This is so sad. My deepest sympathies for the families. All of themMan... I was here thinking it was just some rumor on Twitter since that\\'s where I first came across the news. This is so sad.Maybe I\\'m getting too sensitive but can people calm down with the \"dark, edgy\" jokes? A father and his daughter just died in a tragic accident. This really isn\\'t the time to make jokes imoHorrible and shocking news. May he, his daughter, and everyone else who was on board rest in peace.Nine confirmed dead, pending identification of the deceased.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas%3f_amp=true[removed]Look, I\\'ve never followed or even liked NBA. But when I hear his name it\\'s like I automatically know he\\'s a NBA player. And holy fuck I\\'m shook that he has passed. RIP and thought and prayers for his family and friends.The fuck? People like that don\\'t *just die*.This is very sad.I\\'m not a basketball fan (being Irish, I don\\'t have that exposure), but he\\'s a household name over here. Christ.Feel so bad for his family... Especially for losing their daughter too. Wow...[deleted][removed]I think they are saying now that 9 people were on the helicopter.LA county sheriff reports 9 passengers listed on manifest.   RIP. Just saw handheld video of the crash.  Terrifying spiral into explosion.  Unconfirmed.  Edit: can’t confirm the video I saw.  Handheld and after further investigation the hillsides don’t match.[removed]tragic, but how fast was the internet to create and laugh at tasteless 9/11 gifs?  the same day or after iircThis is really sad. He seemed a wonderful family man and a person with a heart to build and lift others up in life. Too young too go.I saw they were doing moments of silence at today’s games, including in Denver.As a Nuggets fan growing up in Denver, Kobe was constantly booed, and “No means no” was frequently jeered. I hope people were respectful.Games should be cancelled todayOk.WHO THE FUCK GAVE THE AWARD MADE ME SMILEEdit: don’t read this it’s probably all wrong.Seems like the clouds were low and the *GUESS* is that the helicopter pilot was “scud running.”  Scud running is flying lower than you normally would so you’re not flying in clouds where you can’t see anything.  A qualified pilot is going to fly in the white clouds and go by instruments... that’s safer than flying low.  The mountains in that area, where the crash happened, are similar to a canyon.   Some experts are saying this was a CFIT... controlled flight in to terrain.  The pilot may have been too low, and flew right into the mountain/hillside without anyone in the vehicle realizing until milliseconds before they crashed.I don’t think it was a terror “the whole way down” for them... if that makes any difference or helps anyone thinking about it :( ... :/. RIP.I finished watching a movie, deleted it off of my PVR and then began watching SportsNet. They were talking about LeBron having bested Kobe\\'s record, but were talking oddly like Kobe was dead, but it felt surreal. I thought maybe they were talking that way because the record was beaten, and were doing some sort of memoriam for it. But no.This really reminds me of the Halladay crash, which was a massive and sad shock.Rest in peace.Throwing a ball of paper in the garbage and yelling Kobe ain’t ever gonna be the sameStill can’t believe this is true, a legend hone just like that and his daughter too :(wtf?! Jesus Christ, when I saw the first few words I assumed I was in some kind of WritingPrompts subreddit or something. Jesus Christ.Who were the other people in the helicopter??This is nuts. Too damn young. 2020 I’m not liking you already.Damn, that is terrible. This should serve as a reminder. Helicopters should be a \"only if need to be air lifted to the hospital\" sort of thing. They are not a toy, or a safe mode of transportation/ sight seeing.edit: there was an annual average of 1.44 fatalities (PDF) per 100,000 flying hours in nonmilitary helicopters. Over the same period, there were 13.2 traffic fatalities per 100,000 population in the United States annually. Since the average American spends around 780 hours per year (PDF) in the car, that means the fatality rate per 100,000 hours of driving time is just 0.017. Based on hours alone, helicopters are 85 times more dangerous than driving.For example - Helicopters cover a lot more ground in an hour than a driver on the New Jersey Turnpike, so it might be better to come at the question from another angle. There are approximately 0.8 deaths on the interstate highway system for every 100 million miles traveled. There have been a fair number of studies on the average speed on the interstate system with varying results, but the average is probably somewhere around 68 miles per hour, give or take a few mph. That means it took drivers approximately 1.47 million hours to travel those 100 million miles, yielding a fatality rate of 0.054 per 100,000 hours in the car. By this measure, helicopter flying is just 27 times more dangerous than driving.Officials say they believe 9 people were on board -- 1 pilot and 8 passengers -- and there were no survivors. Still unclear why the chopper crashed but an investigation is under way.I\\'ve never been into sports but Kobe Bryant is a household name and learning of his death along with his daughter was an absolute shock. All the prayers and blessings to his family.[removed]https://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhF6JCrLY8MowoO5aCAbsolute sadness, no words...So sad, he was an idol from my youth. Growing up in the Netherlands, basketball isn\\'t very populair, but staying up late to watch him play was amazing. Got two jersey\\'s, i should wear them more often. R.I.P. Mamba and your little girlMy heart really pours for Kobe\\'s youngest daughter, who is now going to grow up without any memories of her father and oldest sister.Absolutely tragic. Thankyou Kobe for being a legend on and off the court and supporting athletes around the worldToday basketball is absolutely meaningless.What a loss, a tough loss for his family.Not trolling, but wasn\\'t Kobe a rapist?R.I.P Sad to see a great person go[deleted]His rap album gonna go triple platinum now. R.I.P Kobe 😭Man, his daughter was with him. So awful. You will never get me on a helicopter.2:40pm PST: \"Officials say they believe 9 people were on board -- 1 pilot and 8 passengers -- and there were no survivors. Still unclear why the chopper crashed but an investigation is under way.\" - TMZJust watched a live stream of the press conference and authorities think there were 9 people on board, 8 plus the pilot. Not sure why the reports were all saying 5 originally. Maybe with the wreckage it wasn’t immediately clear. Just horrifying.This is crazy. Me and my bf were literally at the train stop watching two helicopters take off earlier today. They were those tourist rides over the city type - but for some reason we were just really taken with them. Watched them both until they took off. I found out about Kobe\\'s death about 30 mins later. Spooky.[removed]Obviously I’m not blaming him but helicopters are notoriously unsafe and I’d never get in one. That machine is in a perpetual state of trying to rip itself apartWhat he did for the WNBA and fair pay, what he did for his daughters and the world they would grow up in... he truly grew into a great human being. A terrible loss for all of us.That\\'s why you don\\'t go in heilcopers ppl...Now reports state that there were a total of 9 people in that helicopter.Edit: Vanessa and the other children are reportedly safe and were not on the flight.I\\'m not even a Basketball fan but this hit me hard.RIP to the unfortunate victims of the accident.[removed]this is truly heartbreaking, my condolences to the entire Bryant family and friend, but i have a legit question guys. So the crash scene was in flames like engulfed, how did they find out so quickly that it was Kobe? i understand they can look at the helicopter and probably track down who was in it but that would’ve taken time. i assume there wasn’t much identification that could’ve been done( sorry, no offense) or would they still be able to verify the bodies? not trying to be morbid i’m just genuinely curious as to how they identified the passengers so quick to news.NBC confirmed there were 9 people on the helicopter (2:50pm Western Time)Additional information posted: Orange Coast College (OCC) baseball coach John Altobelli died in the helicopter crash with Kobe Bryant early Sunday morning, OCC assistant coach Ron La Ruffa told Orange County Register newspaper[source](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/kobe-bryant-dies-in-helicopter-crash/index.html)God bless his wife and surviving kids.[removed]Condolences - Kobe was a great and cultured man. His daughter was too young.Kobe was a life long fixture,  I feel so bad for his wife and family.Good grief.  Now the authorities are saying 9 people were killed in the crash?  This just keeps getting worse.[removed]R.I.P to the aircrew too since everyone only care about the famous people.How many people can fit on a helicopter?One of the most tragic stories I\\'ve lived through.Kobe was the definition of superstar for me! RIP Bryant 8.Kobe was such a tough man throughout his career that I really believed he would survive... until the NBA confirmed it.There was 9 People in that heli!Rip to all involved. Not just cobe and kin.This is so terrible and heartbreaking. RIP to a true legend. Hope his family can get through thisIt’s worse now. The LAPD is saying there were nine onboard...This year has been too much... Rest in Power Kobe... gone before your time.I cant wrap my head around this. Her daughter invited a class mate too, think about, they were probably so exicted to go on it, just a trip. As it was going down, having to think that your going to die... fuck that. I dont even want just say \"f\", this is just, depressingI wish I could up vote this 24 times. RIP Kobe.Honestly insane to believe, Kobe was a household name growing up whether you played basketball, watched basketball, or you didnt even watch basketball you knew who Kobe Bryant was. This is the most tragic and unexpected celebrity death since Princess Diana (when looking at global impact). RIP Kobe and his daughter along with the 3 others who lost their lives.I\\'ve never cried this much for someone I\\'ve never personally met. Los Angeles native life long Lakers fan.[deleted][deleted]Damn 2020 really be like that huhMy dad was a big fan of Kobe, and when I told him about Kobe\\'s passing, he seemed flabbergasted and upset. Boy, will we miss him. :/It\\'s all over the internet, it states that 5 people in total. Kobe, his daughter, another player and the players parent.  One of the sites I looked at said mother of 2nd teammate.He died doing what he loved. Not just basketball but being a good father, every man that idolizes him should remember that. Absent fathers are destroying the black community. Honor kobe. Follow in his footsteps and become a great father. Because that\\'s what kobe truly was. And amazing father who just so happened to be one of the greatest of all time at basketball. That\\'s the best way we can remember him. Life can be over any minute for anyone. Legends dont live forever but die in nonsensical accidents. Any of us can be taken by something so trivial such as slipping on ice or a limb falling from a tree. Just because you fly 400 times doesn\\'t mean nothing will happen the 401st. Don\\'t hold grudges, hug the ones you love, but don\\'t live in fear, live to the fullest in every way you can. Be the black mamba, take what\\'s yours and write your legend.We can never truly say goodbye to kobe, his legend is immortal, so instead I\\'ll say take care and goodluck on the next journey Kobe and giannaI’m not a basketball fan. I don’t watch sports. I haven’t sat down and watched an entire Lakers game. But I lived my whole life hearing this guy’s name. He’s been in the news as I sat at the dinner table eating with my family, he’s been in textbook math problems I solved in school, he’s been on trading cards my classmates passed between each other in middle school. He’s been on t shirts and billboards and cereal boxes and all sorts of mundane things in the background of my life as I grew up. For years. My sister even named her son after this man. Someone like that seems... almost immortal. Like death cannot and will not dare touch them. And the knowledge that that person, who I knew of without knowing them, is now gone... it hits different. I am 23, still young, but this makes death feel a little realer than it did before.I’m in shock. I can’t imagine what his loved ones are feeling. So incredibly tragic.A twin engine utility helicopter crash, that helicopter is meant for flying high profile pax. IFR fog conditions on what was probably a VFR flight. Flying too low to auto rotate? The NTSB report will be an interesting read. Very unfortunate circumstancesNow, they\\'re saying 9 dead?!The people who awarded this post with the \\'Made Me Smile\\' award are savageIs this that guy from the American meme \\'kobe!\\' ?Edit: yo thanks I got itRIP Kobe I’m so sad and speechless.Sources saying there were 9 total, 8 passengers with 1 pilot. That\\'s even worse.&#x200B;To all the assholes cheering at Kobe\\'s death, remember that 8 other innocent people died, including his daughter.Really? 69 silvers? You guys are monsters... Memeing at a time like this smh8 passengers and the pilot. How heartbreaking...This belongs here. [lil Wayne performs Kobe Bryant ](https://youtu.be/hCH-owsrC-A)I literally had a dog named after this man and I don\\'t even watch Basketball. He was one of the only things I actually understood about the sport. Holy crapABC news just reported 9 people are killed in the crash.The blood contract expired.[removed]I  guess more info to come.  They just announced 9 people dead.  They are likely trying to notify family before mentioning namesI never knew that the death of someone whom I\\'ve never met could make me this sad.I still have my basketball card collection with Kobe (something I collected when i was a kid in the 90’s in Copenhagen, Denmark). Kobe was, and still is, a legend. He will never be forgotten !For the love of god, no one let his family go watch the new bad boys for life movie.This hits me oddly hard, since Bryant was really the first professional athlete who was my age. He was starting for the Lakers my senior year of high school.So now there were nine people on the helicopter according to that sheriff?? That lady yanked him from that podium so fast after he answered that first question.RIP to a great player and father. RIP GiGi. 💔[removed]I\\'m not a basketball fan. But even I know who Kobe is. This is extremely sad.I think one of the many reasons this is hitting me hard is because after Kobe won his Oscar and was so hands on his daughter\\'s basketball team, it became apparent that he was going to have a very successful post basketball career so to see that end is also tragic.Wow that dude who said his sister died on the crash was telling the truth. They updated a new fatality count based on the manifest and the details he shared lined up and the brother in law posted on Facebook. What a tragedy, condolences to the families affectedCan\\'t imagine how his wife must feel. Loss of a spouse and a child. Absolutely tragic.Press conference said 9 people died on board. I really hope there weren’t more children from his daughter’s team, too... this is already so sad. 😩Newest report stated 9 people have passed away in the accident. Story is getting worseSheriff\\'s live broadcast confirms a total of 9 victims on board the helicopter....though their identities are not yet known my heart and thoughts are with them all.[removed]They’re saying 9 people now?...oh my God.Man, I hated Kobe as a player. He was the selfish enemy.But this is terrible. And his daughter too?  Man, so sad. I feel for his family and fans.Damn, LA law enforcement just confirmed 9 people were onboard the helicopter.  AwfulSources now say NINE people were on board.God I wish that was meDid the sheriff just confirm 9 bodies... Not 5?! Omg...[deleted]9 people according to news conference!Jesus christ man, this is extremely sad. His little daughter as well. Rest in peace!Holy shit. Official press conference just announced 9 involved in the crash.2020: New Super virus in China rapidly spreading. Australia is burning to a crispTrump is still presidentKobe Bryant dies a horrific death with one of his daughters2020, calm down, you ain’t 2016.Rip the legend who inspired so manyDuring the live press conference, the sheriff said that they believe there were 9 people on board, a pilot and 8 passengers. He also called out TMZ for being wildly inappropriate and said “imagine finding out a loved one has died through social media”, he has requested that people stop speculating who was on board and to keep their loved ones in mind.Edit: I watched the rest, this time the man that spoke before the sheriff came back (man with a grey streak in his hair, dark green shirt and dark skin):they don’t know anything for sure yet. They received the report 9:47 AM, arrived 8 minutes later and due to magnesium, the fire took one hour to extinguish. The coroner is on site with a team and they’re working hard to get answers.They don’t know what happened, they don’t know where the helicopter took off, they don’t know for sure where it was going (these three questions kept being asked). It will take some time to identify everyone and to notify the next of kin, he once again stressed for people to stop speculating and to keep loved ones on mind. The area that they are investigating is “about an acre”, that’s also where they expect most debris to be at and where bushes were on fire.Honestly, it was him constantly repeating that they don’t know what happened yet since the press kept asking the same questions. They also kept pestering him about “taking an hour to extinguish” - but again, that’s because of the magnesium.After that they called for a spokesperson that can speak Spanish and I turned it off.[Good news article here that has a better summary of the conference and updates](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas).4 passengers.  Kobe, his daughter,  a fellow teammate and the teammates mother along with the pilot that died.  Very sad, its assumed this is due to pilot error due to foggy conditions.Oh god they’re reporting now that there were 8 passengers not 4. Thoughts to the familiesCNN  is saying there are nine dead in crashPolice chief just said it may be nine bodies found on the crash scene?A true legend and inspiration to the world over. The world is a darker place without him. Rest in power King.Just comfirmed 9 people were aboard and all died.RIP to the greatest rapist to ever play in the nba.9 people on board, 1 pilot and 8 passengers just mentioned at the press conference[deleted]Absolutely heartbroken. Such terrible news to wake up toThere were apparently a total of 9 people on board!!! Oh my goodnessThey just said 9 people dead in crash.Don\\'t donate to reddit. Donate to something worthwhile.I’m gonna miss him, Rest In Peace Kobe[removed]Oh, man his daughter died... That is affecting me more somehow...Fuck.  9 people on boardCelebrity deaths rarely affect me, but this one stings.  Kobe is about a month and a half younger than me. I remember him in the news when I was in high school.  I saw him become the best player in the NBA. I then read about him starting his second chapter of his life as a venture capitalist and had high hopes for him.  Now this.  And then to find out his eldest daughter also died.  This is terrible.  I can only imagine the pain his wife and family must be feeling.I still cannot believe this happened. My heart is broken. Keep your loved ones close to you and hug them like there is no tomorrow. Death doesn’t discrimine whether you are rich or poor, fat or skinny or even if you are the black mamba....death will come for you.While this is sad news why do none of the reports mention the others in the helicopter. They are people too with families.[deleted][removed]Fuck. This hits different. I woke up to this convincing myself that this is fake and a joke. I can’t believe this is real.I’m stunned and devastated....he and GiGi were my distant cousins. Please keep all five of the departed souls and their loved ones in your thoughts and prayers.Such a tragedy for the game. Definitely left a legacy and a mentality to be emulated. Such a gruesome way to die.  Sad for all the passengers and families involved :/BBC news show LeBron James instead of Kobe Bryant. https://twitter.com/ncarrington01/status/1221560137384714240Shit, time for my feed to be filled with helicopter safety awareness posts.R.I.P. Kobe Bryant you will be missed.Not a Basketball fan.Barely paid attention to KB.But this is tragic and I can\\'t imagine the pain his family is going though right now.  I know they will have limitless support and love of their family, friends and fans... and I wish them all the strength they need.BBC news show LeBron James instead of Kobe Bryant. https://twitter.com/ncarrington01/status/1221560137384714240[removed][removed]So many lives ended due to helicopter crashes??

RIP Gianna.>First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year. Although this year has been incredibly difficult for me personally, I can only imagine the pain she has had to endure. I also want to apologize to her parents and family members, and to my family and friends and supporters, and to the citizens of Eagle, Colorado.Kobe Bryant apologizing to the 19 year old girl he raped in 2003.Wow, totally shocked.Non-American but was a huge Basketball fans in the era of Bird and Magic, kept half an eye on what was happening.Was just at home with a family and an advert came on for Rugby. My Mum remarked that \\'a Rugby man just died\\', I asked who and she grabbed her phone, she had a news alert pop up, then read Kobe\\'s name.I grabbed it to read the story. Let her know this guy was a HUGE Basketball star and not a Rugby guy!Terrible news, what a way to die, daughter too and poor wife and kids left behind too.We lost a gentle soul today, a incredible change maker, a ambassador of sport and loving husband and father. Words cannot describe how much I feel for the Bryant family.  A legend and his daughter taken too soon.Wow this just seems supper weird I’m not a basketball fan at all but Kobe is one of those legends that seems like he would be around forever like Michael Jordan or Shaq rest in piece. If I’m ever famous I’m never riding in a helicopter it seems so many celebrities die in those.RIP in peace everyone involved.Jeezus this is the most random tragedy ever. RIP to him and his daughter, speechless.When a helicopter seems like the best way to shave an hour off your trip, you have too much money.Crazy. 48 minutes by car on Google maps. I guess once you\\'ve tried a helicopter to avoid LA traffic, it would be easy to get used to.I went to school with Natalia and his entire family were some of the nicest, humble people I knew. Favorite memory of him was when he came into our first grade classroom and brought all the kids lakers sweatshirts on valentintes day. Truly an amazing person. Rest in peaceMy stomach is in knots thinking about how they must’ve felt before the helicopter crashed. He was such a good father as everyone could see, I can’t imagine what pain and terror they must’ve experienced. Heartbreaking.I was fortunate  enough to have lived to see Michael  Jordan dominate,  and I always said kobe is the closest thing to being the next  jordan I ever seen . I got to watch all of Kobe\\'s career .  And to this day I still say he was second to jordan when it came to a cut throat mentality  . He was a very special player. May God bless his family. May his soul rest in peace as well as his daughters and the other people on board. It was an honor to get to watch your career Kobe. Be in peace .RIP LEGEND, you will be missed!Oh this is terrible! I don\\'t follow sports much, but I learned a bit about Kobe when he was my reddit gifts secretsanta favorite player. I ended up painting a sports action picture of him for my giftee. What a sad loss for the sports world. My heart hurts for the 4 passengers and the pilot who perished.[deleted]Didn\\'t watch Basketball but he\\'s a household name in NBA. I\\'m honestly shocked about this. RIP.Thoughts and prayers to his wife and daughters 🙏How? Human error? Mechanical error?Who gave the “made me smile awards?”Kobe was a father figure to my fiancé who lost his dad when he was very young, he is devastated - please give me tips on how I can help him!!One of the hardest workers and best role models I’ve ever seen. Thank you Kobe ✊Kobe wasn\\'t my favorite player or anything but he\\'s just a little older than me. So I\\'ve watched his whole journey. He had his issues but the person he\\'s become was special. Literally, my saddest day in sports.[deleted]Shocked and in disbeliefSuch a horrifying way to leave this world Kobe, his daughter and the 3 others on the flight will have all our thoughts and prayers with themStar , hero ,athlete,father what a sad day it is...RIP. So sad and surreal.I feel for his family and the family of the others that passed away in this crash. I’m kind of just stunned by this like many of you must be. Rest In Peace.I just shot something into a trashcan and yelled \"Kobe!\" as I did it. It was sad. :( I made it through.Legends never die. RIPCrazy cartoon predicted it years ago.  Something’s up if you ask me: https://youtu.be/_Kt7ebVzBA8Oh shit... that’s horrid news. Wow.... RIPAfter everything that went on between LeBron and Kobe last night too. It’s like something out of a tragic movie.Him and Aaliyah really died on an airplane crash :/ both were legends in their own rightIf I’m not mistaken I have seen reports that his daughter was among those in the crash aswell?Man it’s one thing to find out people like Kobe dying in their sleep or something peaceful. But finding out he and his daughter (and the others) probably burned to death in the crash or died in extreme pain & fear, that just makes it so much worse.Mambas on a helicopterOh my god. Reporters are already linking to the stories about the previous accusations against him. I can’t imagine being so tasteless. So sorry for the families.I realize that this post may make some people angry, but I\\'m just going to post this here, not for attention, but so you\\'ll understand why some people bring up that this superstar athlete was in no way a goody two shoes and not everyone is mourning his passing. It isn\\'t because they cant relate. Most likely it\\'s because they can relate, to that of Kobe\\'s victim. If you havent been a victim of something like rape, or are close to someone who was, you wont understand why they need to bring up that he wasnt all that people praise him to be. He may have been a star athlete. Yes, he may have also helped others, as many times athletes do to maintain their image...but he also raped someone and got away with it. Just because he wasnt convicted, doesnt mean he wasnt guilty. And that\\'s all I will say about that.Ari Shaffir (shock “comedian”) is a garbage human being. He’s happy Kobe is dead. Run that POS out of LA and out of the industryhttps://twitter.com/JTLRUSH/status/1221553753268137990Kobe sentiments from my life;Shaquille O\\'Neal was my favorite NBA player growing up, so I became a Lakers fan once he left Orlando and joined the Lakers, which also coincided with Kobe Bryant\\'s rookie season in LA. Kobe was a really exciting young player, I remember a lot of great plays, the All Star games and Slam Dunk competitions, the swagger, etc.After a few years I switched to being a Timberwolves fan, because I am from Minnesota - and Kevin Garnett will always be my favorite athlete of all time, but Kobe Bryant and the Lakers were still there beating the TImberwolves in the playoffs during many of their peak years. They also both had the \"straight out of high school connection\", Garnett in 95 and Bryant in 96.NBA Basketball during my middle school and high school years was amazing, mid 90\\'s to early 2000\\'s NBA will never be replicated to me. Kobe Bryant was one of the most exciting players during that era.His 13 year old daughter. This shit sucks. All these peoples lives cut so short. Rest in piece, every one of those who lost their lives.Wow. The headline didn\\'t register in my brain for like 20 seconds. A true tragedy. The world lost an amazing athlete, and a young girl with great potential, along with Anyone else on board who passed away. I hope his family can eventually find some peace.I feel like there are way too many helicopter crashes.  Personally I would never fly in a helicopter unless it was an emergencyKobe, your achievements are great and we hold you beyond respect. It is in tremendous sadness that we learn of your passing. We send the family and the people most effected or deepest condolences.Wow that is fucking sad.BBC News just showed footage of LeBron whilst reporting on Kobe’s death.Why do celebrities still ride in helicopters when they crash all the time? I know they dont literally crash that often but some fairly famous people whom ive admired have all died this way.I feel for the daughter, pilot and other passengers but I have little pity for rapists. Imagine being his victim and having to hear about him being an amazing person for the next couple weeks.A real example of rape culture is how we just forget about this shit when the rich and powerful do it.what the fucking shitThis is terrible. I know helicopters save more lives than they take but they still scare the shit out of me. They\\'re always one malfunction away from the ground.Oh my god.... I just can’t believe this....It\\'s sad that someone died. But there\\'s probably a starving kid who died on a dirt floor somewhere as well. So it\\'s against my values to treat this any differently.Let\\'s not forget that there were other people in the helicopter too. Rest in peace 🙏🏽[https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession)what sucks is that they shouldn’t have been flying that heli in the first place due to the weather conditions. heartbroken, RIP legend and all others on board.Who the fuck gave made ke smile and timeless beauty etc. awards like wtfKobe Bryant Death Predicted by cartoon https://youtu.be/2vJUNsn_wgUMan, if weather is bad...just say no to flying in a copter.His daughter was on her way too, talented as hell.. smh plus its gloomy outside where I\\'m at just making it worse.DAmn too soo. I wonder if he ever got to tell Shaq how his ass tastes.I didn’t watch basketball often, but I always watched Kobe’s games, and it’s heartbreaking to hear that him and his daughter are dead. R.I.P a legendThis is a horrible situation, and what Kobe gave to the game of basketball should be remembered, but let’s not allow his fame (or prior legal/personal issues) overshadow the fact that two children are dead. That is absolutely the most tragic part.Hate to say? So sorry for the loss - but his 13 year old daughter died also - his live was fulfilled by his expertise etc, his poor daughter and her life has been taken away through tragedy and fame... Rip both x[removed]You cannot describe the cultural significance or a sports player like a great player in basketball. Ball is life and this man was one of the best ever. This is a true loss to a culture. Retired or not, this will be felt for a long time.I still cannot believe this, hours later.  Honestly I never really cared for Kobe as a player.  I always thought of him as slightly overrated.  His post-basketball career, however, has been nothing short of inspirational.  I cried today for Kobe and Gianna.  Fuck man[removed]I was driving in southern california last night and it was very foggy.Who is this ?Also are helicopters more dangerous than other forms of travel?Edit.Why are we being downvoted for not having a clue who this man is ? We don\\'t live in a America or follow sport and we.presume  He s an American sportsman? My family saw the news and all asked me the same question.  Who is this man who has sadly died in a terrible accident...A tragic reminder to love those around you today.Holy shit, this is beyond horrible. RIP, Kobe.Damn, he was too young. His daughter was WAY too young. Rest in peace Black Mamba.Goodbye my childhood hero in a very far country.  The baskets I shout out your name, a childhood passing by imitating you.  I will miss you so much. -a big fan from an insignificant neighborhood of a distant third world country.Damn. I\\'m not a basketball fan but met Kobe several times at one of the places I used to work at in Newport Beach, Ca. He always a cool dude.Oh my god. RIP a legend.This is way too unexpected and sudden.I hope it was quick, rip.[removed]So was it kind of proven that he raped that girl a while ago? Even if he did, by no means am I happy he died, but does anyone know the details of that case? Did it look like he actually did rape her and there was supporting evidence of that? Because if not then his name should not be tainted at all like it is in my mind. But if it looks like he actually raped her, then blah that\\'s real shitty of him.This is so incredibly sad.I was wondering why this dude in rocket league kept saying rip kobe, and rip his kids. I thought it was some new form of trash talkLast time I felt like this was when Anthony Bourdain passed. RIP Mamba.I just woke up today and my parents told me he was dead. I can’t even believe it still. RIP to him and his daughter. One of the all time greats.Sorry to hear about him and his family, but how does this story have over 12k in comments, but stories on  issues like healthcare, climate change, the income disparity, our declining life expectancy compared to other 1st world nations get maybe 200 comments? I don\\'t understandRIP to Kobe and his daughter, Gianna. RIP.What in the actual fuck!Its surreal that he passes away one day after lebron took his 3rd place in all time scoring.[removed]Mess with Mob shit turns south quick...[removed]Its only January god damnit.Fucking 2020 hits like a truck.Man this hit me like a truck. :| I had to look at several sources before it sank in to my head that he\\'s gone.Why are all the awards celebrating his death? That’s so fucked up to meMy condolences to his family.[deleted][deleted]How much more dangerous is a helicopter than a car statistically?? Is it worth the risk to save the time?  They were only going from Calabasas to Thousand Oaks. Not a very long drive at all. Why risk it??  I don\\'t get it.Condolences to his wife, his extended family, and his fans. I\\'ve never been one to follow sports heavily but it\\'s hard to accept the lose of someone who is both legendary for his skill on the court, but also his kindness.Few people have accomplished what he had in there career, and fewer have done so while remaining humble. Rest in peace, Mr. Bryant. You will be missed.Honestly never been all that impacted by a celebrities death. But last night I had just watched lebrons post game talk to the reporters after he passed Kobe on the all time scoring list. He spoke about how much he idolised him and now he’s gone I can’t stop scrolling through the internet just to find the next post reporting his death. It feels better just to keep looking at him for a little bit longer. His poor poor family losing father and daughter in the same day. RIP 🙏🏻This can\\'t be real. Unbelievable.World\\'s so dark and we still got folks putting their political opinions in here. Take the time to celebrate KB and everyone else who\\'s fallen save for those with genuine evil in their hearts, if you can\\'t do that, you\\'ve got evil in your heart.For an interesting read, sort by controversial...Kobe molded my entire mindset when it comes to my competitiveness. I’m not one to lose sleep over the passing of famous people. But damn... this one is different. **RIP Kobe**. Mamba Mentality will live on forever.[deleted]Holy shit his oldest daughter was with him too. My condolences to the family and rip to the other passengers.this comment section is a perfect example of how toxic and low this site and many of its inhabitants can be.I don\\'t see anyone talking about the other victims yet so I will share some info here.TMZ confirmed one other passenger was confirmed, John Altobelli. I would assume his daughter, 12 or 13 year old Alyssa Altobelli, who [according to this article](https://2paragraphs.com/2019/10/lakers-coach-says-kobe-bryants-daughter-young-killa-in-the-making/) has played with \\'Gigi\\' Bryant in the past, was the other passenger, as they were headed to practice together.Now here\\'s the thing. Kobe has been known to fly his own helicopters. Whether or not he was the pilot is yet to be confirmed. If he is, I imagine another member of the Altobelli family was involved, or possibly a third girl who was a member of the team. Alyssa Altobelli is in [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzgVg4JFXsN/?utm_source=ig_embed). Her father, John, was the longest tenured baseball coach in his school\\'s history.RIP all involved.I feel so sorry for his family, especially as they not only lost a living legend and father but also GiGi, his 13 year old daughter. RIP Kobe and GiGi.Never understand why people like to fly in choppers. I\\'ve seen too many cases of them crashing to ever feel safe in one.I mean a helicopter as a mode of transport is so unnecessary. Surely that the moral of this story.Honestly big love to Kobe and his family. RIP. A legend has gone.What do these emoji badges on the top of this post mean?[removed]Anyone else catch the MSMBC Anchor call his team the n-word?Because. Wow. Fired. So fucking fired. https://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhF6JCrLY8MowoO5aCI played basketball as a kid. I was horrible and probably had 10> point for my season. But you know who I looked up to that whole time? The person that literally inspired me to play and who I thought of everyday I was on that court?Rest in Power. Thank you for your inspiration to so many.[removed]Man, can we just please unplug 2020 and then plug it back in without fucking saving?[removed]When I read the title I thought this post was some sick joke or messed up meme. I was literally watching Kobe videos on YouTube on Friday because the algo showed up his videos on my feed. This is surreal and sad. I was a huge Kobe fan growing up. Unreal. RIPAh man this breaks my heart, I’m in utter shock right now. His poor wife and daughters.. it’s going to be extremely hard on them.Buckle up everybody 2020 is NOT fucking around.[removed]I can\\'t imagine what kind of cowardly person you must be to celebrate someone\\'s death regardless of how you feel about them. Some of yall should be ashamed.[deleted]It’s weird, I couldn’t stand him for a long time.  He destroyed all my favorite teams, made it look easy.  Now I’m crying in the bathroom, wtf.A helicopter has taken many people.  I stopped liking them after they took Stevie Ray Vaughn from us.God damn 2020 sucks: on the verge of WW3, a viral pandemic beginning to sweep across the globe, a cherished father and daughter killed. It’s all pretty surreal. And I thought 2019 was shit.Why are helicopter accidents so frequent suddenly?  In 2018, Leicester City F.C owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha dies in a helicopter crash outside King Power Stadium. 2 months later, the governor of Puebla (Mexico) dies in a helicopter crash. 2019, a helicopter crash involving a Hawaiian Tour Company resulting in 10 deaths. Now, Kobe Bryant dies too? Stay away from helicopter\\'s I\\'d say.Can we just skip this year? 2020 fucking sucks.Now I guess Gianna his 13 year old :(I pulled my home page up a few minutes ago, saw the headline, and my heart fell into my stomach.  My first thought is that this cannot be real.  Then I saw the headline from other websites.  And now I just sit here sick at my stomach.   A sad, sad day.It’s always weird to lose an icon. You have never met then rarely think about them but still it effects you.I came just to read the dumbasses that have no respect in the comments. No surprise. This site really full of yin and yang on the same coin.RIP to everyone that died in the crash. This is just incredibly sadFrom Kobe\\'s \"Dear Basketball,\" animated by Glen Keane and music by John Williams.\"It\\'s time to say goodbye  and that\\'s okay  I\\'m ready to let you go  I want you to know now  So we both can savor every moment we have left together  The good and the bad  we have given each other all that we have  and we both know  no matter what I do next  I\\'ll always be that kid with rolled-up socks, garbage can in the corner, five seconds on the clock, ball in my hand.

I don\\'t watch any sports, never have.  But kobe bryant was always one of those names that transcended their niche, both as a player and as a decent human being.  I didn\\'t even follow the man or the sport, but it still takes my breath away to think a person can die like this.  I hope his family can find some peaceDamn.  Im not a basketball fan.  Hell the entirety of what I follow in sports is my late grandpas favorite nascar driver (Joey lagano), and whenever a team from Pennsylvania makes it to their respective championships/ playoffs.  But even I know this is gotta be a huge loss to basketball.  Like or hate him this dude held world records, and well thats what i know.  But damn.Christ, he was one of the many people you would 100% know as a kid too. He is a legend. Heartbroken.I don’t even know what to say. Saddened 😭As a parent all I can think about is how he was probably holding his daughter so tight in the last moments, trying to protect her. So devastatingI cant imagine how his family feels. This is so sad; two lives cut tragically short.\"How the good die young.\" I hate to think I could die at any time. Kobe was cheated out of 40 or so more years of Living. He even lost his daughter.I can’t count how many sleepless nights I had just to watch him live while I was a teenage (timezone difference). This is so heart breaking. You will be remembered sir.I was lucky enough to see him play against the rockets in his final season. He will be missedSo I know this’ll get buried, but I’d like to see the video of what happened. GPS data shows the helicopter was going 170mph at impact, and the pilot obviously tried to direct the vehicle away from houses/roads. I wonder what happened.This is fucking with me big time. He was my Mom\\'s **FAVORITE** player and this is reminding me of her death (she passed in July).I was just watching the kobe beef episode with kobe on good mythical morning. I cant believe thisR.I.P. to Kobe, as well as Gianna (his daughter) and to the other passengers.Kobe Bryant, Terry Jones, Niel Peart. 2020 off to a great start. :( RIPKobe, his daughter, her friend/teammate, her parents and the pilot. Rest in peace. Kobe was my favourite when I was young playing basketball. This breaks my heart.I was ALWAYS a Kobe hater. I was big T-Mac fan back in high school when they were rivals and two of the best players in the mid 2000’s. With that being said, I’m feeling terribly sad for the basketball world to lose such a legend. I feel so bad for being a “Kobe hater” all these years and always rooting against him. Kobe Bryant is the closest thing we have to Michael Jordan who is determined to get the ball in the 4th quarter and will his team a win. 5 championships, Lakers legend, RIP KOBE THE BLACK MAMBA BRYANT!Helicopters and private jets seems to be a common risk for the rich and famous. RIP Mamba and everyone else onboard.There\\'s been way too many unnecessary deaths in helicopters. Is there seriously no way to make these things safer? Less prone to killing all on board when they crash? Maybe just not using them? Fuck sake.Why couldn\\'t this happen to that other guy...RIP to Kobe Bryant the legend. 2020 can\\'t possibly get worse than this... can it? 😥Has there been a more iconic sudden athlete death since Clemente?[removed]I think the world could use a do-over for the last 24 hours, just this once.Life really is unpredictable, makes you really not give a shit and want to try everything because you just never know when it’s your time.[removed]As I see people claiming he’s a rapist, I recommend reading this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfCalling him a rapist goes against everything justice stands for[removed]This man is my idol. I learned how to dominate every obstacle with an unwavering competitive spirit. I have had the pleasure of running into him a few times in New Port. He was such a sweet man to his fans and earned all of our respect on and off the court. He lived every minute of his 41 year life to the fullest. I love you Kobe from the bottom of my heart and send out my condolences to your family. RIP you absolute legend.Life is really whimsical. Fuck everything.RIP and condolences to the family and friends.Shit his daughter died too... He was an inspiration to tons of little kids and probably some NBA stars right now. His legacy won\\'t be forgotten. I hope his family can find peace someday.I\\'m shocked and sad. Gone too soon. It feel like he was only just starting to reach his full potential as a human being. Legends never die.No more chopper rides for me.Unbelievable, shocking news. Just retired and about to spend the best years of him with his kids and family.. He really changed the life of many people around the world.This shows that people can die in heli crashes unlike in suicide squad*read news**cries**wipes tears with tissue**rolls tissue into ball**shoots to trash*KOBE!!!!*cries again*[deleted]RIP Kobe Just wow, unbelievable.Thank you for bringing years of determination and grit to basketball.Many fond memories of Kobe on the court, even on the opposing side of the court as a Rockets fan.Such terrible news for his family. Rest easy champ.Best wishes for Kim and Baby North :(His work ethic was admirable. He was a great example to many for his effort and consistency.Being from Chicago it was hard to watch basketball after 98. Kobe kept the league alive for me because you could see that special something in him.I would argue with my friend that Kobe would never be better than Jordan because I\\'m such a big Jordan fan lolFuck man, the amount of respect that I learned to have for Kobe is crazy. I literally cried when he retired because he proved me wrong. He proved that he can be put up there with Jordan and will forever be a legend. Idk why I\\'m saying this shit, I\\'m just really in shock and sad af. His daughter was in there too.Fuck today, man.May him and his daughter rest in peaceAs a wife and mother, my heart is broken for Kobe’s wife and daughters’ right now. I can’t imagine the pain she is going through saying goodbye not only to her husband, but also her little girl. This is so sadI\\'m curious  what Fatelyn Faber has to say about this[removed]Crazy how even non ballers know of him. Truly one of the greats. My first ever favourite player and inspiration for my younger days playing ball. RIP man.Shoot now I can only name one basketball playerRest In Peace Kobe!Your legend will live on!That is tragic...rest in peace Kobe.Jesus. This is horribly tragic. I was at a work event in Vegas last month and he was our guest speaker. Didn’t talk much about his basketball career, but focused more on his passion for storytelling and encouraging his daughters to be anything they wanted to be. He signed all of us a copy of his children’s book Epoca the Tree of Ecrof too. Seemed like a genuinely nice guy. What a damn shame.Good lord, his daughter died in the crash as well. What a terrible eventHere\\'s some prelim flight data, for anyone interested. Nothing that isn\\'t public record already.https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/Tragic that his daughter died.Man so horrible.... I know others were on the helicopter bit imagine your daughter going with you :( knowing there\\'s nothing you can do to protect your daughter!  RIP horrible newsI\\'m not really a basketball fan. But I\\'m aware of the impact he had on the sport. Condolences to his and the other families that were involved.I dunno shit about basketball but I always knew of Kobe. This is crazy and sad.At least he died happyThis is so sad to read. I bless his wife and their 3 other children, this must be incredibly hard for them.Jaystation is gonna have a fun time with this oneI don\\'t even watch basketball anymore but I still appreciate the raw talent and dedication Kobe had to the sport. RIP to him and his daughter as well as sympathy to his wife, surviving daughters, and the other victims in this tragedy.Drove past Calabasas a few minutes ago, saw lots of fire trucks driving around and one helicopter hovering over a mountain.Out of ALL the apps at my disposal.. why was my WEATHER app the first to tell me this??Every time I toss anything into a bucket I yell “Kobe!” when I make the shot. At 41 years old you’re  a legend and a reference the world over.  I don’t think I’ll be tossing anything for a while 😢do stupid things win stupid prizes, why on earth would anyone fly in a helicopter regularily. Stay on the ground. Prayers to his family[deleted]damn this dude just seemed like he was invincible.[removed]Does anyone have information about HOW this happened? Was the helicopter not serviced properly?A human being with immense talent has died in a freak accident. This is absolutely tragic and the people who wanted him to die because he played for a team they did not like have been so conditioned to view athletes as non-human.Gut wrenching. RIP to Kobe and Gianna as well as the others on board. Incredibly sad.Kobe was basketball to me. I mean I loved it years before he got drafted, and to have him come to the Lakers was amazing, then to have him be so great, and when he left the game, I knew it would be a long time before the Lakers had anyone else anywhere near his level of charisma, skill, just overall worth ethic be on the team. RIP Kobe.This is one of those deaths I just can\\'t accept, like Robin Williams and Chester Bennington, it just doesn\\'t make sense.I feel awful for his family considering one of his daughters also died too[removed]Among the victims was Bryant\\'s 13-year-old daughter Gianna.😞What a shame man... what a tragic fucking shame.Everytime i go to shoot a paper ball into to a trashcan.. will be sad now.. RIP MumbaI dont know anything about basketball but I knew his name because when someone blasts my ass with an HE grenade in csgo they all yell it[removed]This was so shocking to hear about. Life truly is fragile and things can turn upside down in an instant :( enjoy what you’ve got while you canCan\\'t we just restart the day...Fuck this year, and we’re not even a month in.[removed]I\\'m legit sad, not NBA fan but knew the legends and he was one.Still have a poster of Kobe in my childhood room at my parents house Adored him since I was a young boy.Beside being one of the greatest players of all timesKobe Bryant was just a cool guy and it seemed liked he could get into any room and give this energy to everyone around himHis kid too? that fucking sucks.[removed]Glad i watched him during is prime years.[deleted]Can\\'t believe someone gave the \"made me smile\" award for such tragic news. What is wrong with some people?Somewhere right now, Neil Peart is smashing his drums for Kobe. And Kobe is saying “WTF is this shit?”They confirmed his 13 year old daughter was on the helicopter as well. :(Regarding that unconfirmed video of the crash itself, it looks like that may be a different area (more sand, less vegetation, and steeper mountains than the crash site photos) than the photos I’ve seen of the confirmed crash siteNot saying it’s fake, but the source is a random twitter accountI don\\'t know much about basketball.  When I was 15 or so (around 1998, I was in a store down at downtown disney with a friend who said \"Holy shit, that\\'s Kobe Bryant.\"  Me being the scrawny nerd of course had no idea who he was.  He was nerding out over Kobe like I\\'d nerd out over Starcraft.  Asked me to go get his autograph for him as he was too intimidated or something.  Anyway, I waltzed right up to him and through his bodyguards, there were 4 or 5 of them (guess I wasn\\'t really perceived as a threat), and asked for his autograph.  Had absolutely nothing for him to write on or with so I said I\\'d be right back, went and got a blank receipt and pen from a cashier, and he was good enough to stand around and wait for me to return and give me the autograph.  All around good dude in my opinion.  Sad to see of his passing.  RIP Kobe.Grew up around LA my whole life, I don\\'t watch much sports, but Kobe Bryant was always the face of the NBA for me, such sad news.I saw this on instagram first and it was so unbelievable I thought it was a meme. Truly horrifying. What a tremendous loss for this world.His oldest daughter just celebrated her birthday a week ago... I can\\'t understand how she must feel right nowI cannot believe the pain his wife and oldest daughter are going through. My heart hurts thinking about it[deleted]When I first read this I couldn\\'t believe it. I still can\\'t believe it. Rest in peace and may God watch over you and your family.Well this isn’t how I expected the new decade to go. I’m a lukewarm NBA fan but damn Kobe was such a legend and a joy to watch throughout his career. Every victim had so many years left ahead of them. Tragic AF. I’m sure his wife is in a heap on the floor, unimaginably distraught like any other parent under the circumstances. My heart aches for her, her surviving daughters, and their extended family and friends.[removed]A couple days ago i saw a helicopter while stuck in traffic and thought man those things are dangerous. I had a thought of kobe possibly dying in a crazy a accident like this. I figured hed be retired and using helicopters all the time.This is so sad.  It\\'s awful his daughter was with him, but they were at least together.  His poor wife and other daughters, though.  RIP Kobe and GiGi.[deleted]> **1:12 PM PT** \\\\-- Rick Fox\\'s attorney confirms the former Laker was NOT among those on board the helicopter, despite rumors that circulated suggesting he was.I\\'m 99.99% Positive this update is mentioning Rick Fox, who was also a former Laker, and rumored to be on the helicopter500 million ,retired in 2016..didnt even get to enjoy his money...[removed]This is why I prefer a car.Don\\'t go to /r/ChapoTrapHouse or any leftist subreddit or Twitter.It\\'s just shit all the way down todaySo nobody care about the others peoples onboard ? RIPi\\'m so sorry to his living daughters and wife.  theres nothing else to say.[removed]Whoa.  Fucking whoa.  Didn\\'t expect to see this today.  Just wow.[deleted]Bigger than basketball.Shit, apparently his daughter was with him.Heroes come and go, but legends are forever.RIP Kobe Bryant.I can\\'t take this... 😭Legends are never forgotten, RIP Kobe.Feels like he retired yesterday, absolutely horrible tragedy :\\\\[[removed]It sucks how rough this year has started out. Hold on to your loved ones, cause it could be over any second. Condolences to his family. Rest easy, to him and his daughter. Not how anyone should ever go out.Anyone else see the update at 1:12? His lawyer said Kobe wasn\\'t on board. Very confusing.Heartbreaking news. Rest In Peace Kobe Bryant.This is sl fucking sad I am broken my childhood hero.A gentle and kind giant.I was out with friends when I heard this news. My heart goes out to his wife and family. I just learned through here that his daughter was on the helicopter as well. So sad....may comfort find its way to his loved ones. 😢The fuck is wrong with 2020Really sad - he won an Oscar for his short film \"Dear Basketball\" and you can catch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziUc0OCDmoU)*Bryant, who retired from playing professional basketball in 2016, won an Oscar for best animated short for \"Dear Basketball,\" which was based on a poem he wrote.**He worked with animator Glen Keane and Oscar-winning composer John Williams on the project, which was about him as a young boy dreaming about becoming a basketball player.**\"It was pretty surreal to see myself animated,\" Bryant told The New York Times after the short was nominated. \"I once dreamed of having a signature Nike shoe, but I never thought I\\'d be animated by Glen Keane -- that pretty much tops everything!\"*Man. I got unexpected feels. We are the same age. So many feelsI just wish the best for his family. You will never get over something like this but I hope that they find peace.Not a sports person myself, but everyone knows Kobe. Surreal checking the news and learning about this. Dude was so young and his daughter was also a victim in the crash. Life is too short and unpredictable. Enjoy the time you have and your loved ones because you never know when it\\'ll end. I remember in school, my classmates would always shout \"Kobe!\" whenever they made a basket, which was kinda my introduction to him.These small air vehicle crashes seem so commonIt\\'s going to be tough for his family, RIP.Fuck man, I really feel this. I don\\'t know why. Fuck.Academy award winner and NBA legend Kobe Bryant.God damn.I don\\'t even watch basketball but Kobe has become a household name. Very sad :( but I think people will be throwing things very high in his name for a long time, this is a nice cultural legacyMan...I want to know why they crashed.  Ran out of gas?  Mechanical?  Makes me so angry...this should not have happened!His 13 year old was in the crash too 🙁[deleted][removed]Seems like trump missed a person in his tweetTragic. Love to his wife and other 3 children. No words.Feeling strangely mortal..RIP Kobe. Best baller of my generation.Breaking: The other two victims among the dead were Gianna’s basketball teammate and their parent. Edit: They were en route to a travel basketball game.https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376?s=21Tragic day for all.Sad we lost Morgan Wootton and Kobe Bryant in the same week.  Two giants in the basketball world.  One as a coach and the other as a player.  It\\'s a tough start to the year.Oh my god this is not news I wanted to hearRIP to the legend, his daughter, and everyone else who passed away.Wow.... that’s fucking terrible... RIP Kobe, you will always be remembered.Why use the word killed in the title, bad choice.At least neither of them were alone. Hope they held each other until the end. So fucking sad dude.“The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do.”Rest in Peace KobeGOAT is of all time, forever, RIP em to pieces.[deleted]Very sad. I am curious what the conspiracy nuts will come up with in the coming days.I really, really hope it was quick and no one suffered.  This is really awful.Rip. You never know when\\'s it\\'s time. Hope he was living life to the fullest.[removed]Do they know who the other people were in the helicopter, rip to them and their familiesF My childhood memory R.I.POmg I keep reading the comments waiting for someone to say this is a great joke reddit pulled off. This is for real?!Such a weird feeling. One of those people you never even thought might die.**1:12 PM PT** \\\\-- Rick Fox\\'s attorney confirms the former Laker was NOT among those on board the helicopter, despite rumors that circulated suggesting he was.     So did he not die then???I still cannot believe it. He will love on forever!I haven\\'t cry like this in a while mya God bless his family.Please let this be fake.Damn, first David Stern and now Kobe. NBA is taking a beating to start 2020.This is a sad day. He was and will remain an icon.I\\'ve never flown in a helicopter, and with all these crashes as of late - I don\\'t ever plan to.RIP Kobe Bryant, and my thoughts go out to the family.2020 = dumpster fire confirmed.  RIP, Kobe.Some of the awards this post got are questionableLife is cruel, RIP KobeI know next to nothing about basketball, but I know who Kobe Bryant is, his legend status translates across all sports and my jaw dropped when I heard the news. RIPThis is fucking horrible. A sporting legend and his daughter dying in such an unexpected fashion is a massive blow. Thoughts and prayers with the family, they\\'ll need it.How do you comfort your daughter when you know you\\'re both gonna die. This thought is fucking me up.[removed]Two wives have lost their husbands and one child in this crash today. I can\\'t even imagine the pain. Sending much peace and love their way.I never liked the guy. He destroyed my Sacramento Kings in their prime. So, there’s still a lingering Fuck Kobe here...but I never wished him death. RIP Black Mamba I’m sorry to see you go.The whole point that I was trying to make is that even the haters (people who hated him beating our asses) would still mourn him was why I wanted to make this statement.I thought it was important to differentiate between sports grudges and real life.  Those subtleties seems to be lost on some people. I’m sorry I didn’t make it more clear. HE DESTROYED MY FAVORITE TEAMS WHEN HE WAS PLAYING BECAUSE HE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY SKILLED AND TALENTED AND IT SUCKS THAT HE DIED DESPITE THOSE PETTY GRUDGES.I hoped that was clear in my comment originally but apparently not.This is shocking. He was far too young.Reports of his daughter Gianna also being on the helicopter just coming out.Deeply saddened by this news. He was taken from the world far too soon. Undeniably inspired generations, and future generations to come. From his style of play to his incredible work ethic and unshakeable mindset - a true champion.Remember every single day when you wake up, no matter how hard the day ahead looks, some people didn\\'t get a chance to wake up today. Go and tackle lifeI can\\'t believe this man 😢 my heart is brokenMy husband has to fly helicopters for he’s job. But he will never get in one on vacation or tour stuff. Now I know why.Update says he was not on the chopper?Edit: my bad, \"Update says Rick Fox was not in the helicopter.\"I\\'m not much of an NBA fan and this saddens meHis poor wife. I can’t even imagine.I couldn’t believe it when I first heard the news, I thought it was a prank or something.I\\'m gonna play Modern Warfare on Shipment, slingin\\' grenades yelling, *KOBE!*, all night, in his honor. R.I.P[removed][deleted]I never looked up to the man myself, but I\\'ve admired several people who all source Kobe as a major inspiration. He has touched so many lives with such a positive influence, and through those he\\'s inspired will continue to touch many, many more.A sad day to be sure. He will be missed by so, so many peopleOmg I just woke up from a nap and saw this. Literally thought it was a dumb joke about Lebron passing him in rankings until I kept scrolling. And his poor daughter and family. Unbelievable.Some weird awards on this post.WTF? Not a big sports fan, but even I know how impactful this guy was. RIP.This adds to my ever growing reasons never to be in a heli[removed][removed]Watch his Oscar winning short titled \"Dear Basketball\" right here https://believeentertainmentgroup.com/portfolio-item/dear-basketball/Small private aircraft - \"Wealthsbane.\"As terrible it is to hear about Kobe, it\\'s worse to hear his oldest daughter was also with him. Kobe had already lived a great life, but she was just beginning hers. RIP to both Kobi and Gianna, and also to the other two unnamed victims of this horrific incident.Edit: sorry, she is the second oldest.Holy shit. I was too young to really be a Jordan fan and grew up watching Kobe win us championships here in LA. RIP.[removed]What!?!?!?! No way is this real?This is a shock, and a real reminder that anyone can die at any time, so cherishing life is important. Condolences to his family, doubly so if it\\'s true that one of his daughters was also on the helicopter.Legends never die.Be the legend in your own lifes story.Be sadBe angryBe hurtBe everything elseBut do not be scared, there is nothing in this life to be scared of.Rest in peace legend... I\\'m just speechless...never honestly muttered, \"no no no\" after reading a headline before. Im not a big sports guy either but he is an icon. Damn, RIP. Thats shocking.[removed]everyday, 2020 gets suckier and suckier! I hate it!!! RIP Kobe :(I remember being a 9 year old kid having nothing in common with my late father. I remember being star struck watching a man drop 81 points on a single game.  This day converted me into a sports fan, and more importantly was something my father and I could relate with. Rest In Peace to a legend.Holy shit this is tragicWhat the fuck man. God no!Worst news since Jose Fernandez.For a non-FOX affiliate:  https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/26/us/calabasas-helicopter-crash-trnd/index.htmlAnyone know where he was flying to/from?I hope there was no foul play and/or negligence. Very sad to hear. He was doing great things in his post-NBA time.[removed]Danny Carey is probably having a meltdown Neal and now KobeLoss of words fuck manMy whole city is in shock right now!I\\'m more upset that his daughter lost her life, too. Nobody deserves to die at age 13.Not too long ago he was pictured alongside his daughter at a basketball game and they seemed so close. She also died today. Rest in peace Kobe and Gianna.Okay guys I keep getting some pretty fucked up messages in my inbox. If you have a problem, especially if it was because he was black, please swallow your cowardice and post it here so you can get the ridicule you deserve.people who are disrespecting Kobe are cunts. His daughter was in that helicopter too, stop celebrating! :(He will always be a legend. R.I.P. Kobe.All of these gold and platinum awards on this post make it look like it\\'s good news., Thumbs up with a rocket and stuff..Never would have imagined Kobe would have died before Michael Jordan.Wow this is unreal. I saw a friend post RIP Kobe Bryant on Facebook and thought he was joking. Checked the news and turns out that he\\'s dead. Just goes to show that anybody can die at anytime.This is probably the most shocking death I\\'ve seen in my life.  In terms of culture icon in North America and still young the only thing I can think of that is comparable would be princess Diana, Michael Jackson was close but being in early 30s he was not really in my time period.I\\'m in complete shock with this news.Very emotional All Star game this year!I looked at my husband in total disbelief when he told me. Its like, are you serious?? Just awful.Dude what the fuck?!!I can’t even make this real in my mind right now....[deleted]Just read that his 13-year-old daughter was also on the flight. :(some hot takes on twitter today boy. causing all kinds of reactions. rest in power to the legend and his daughter along with the others who perished.Watching the news live right now, a whole bunch of people are gathering in front of Staples Center to mourn his passing and pay their respects. One of the guys interviewed was asked how long he was going to stay there, he told the reporter: \"He gave us 20 years, I\\'m not going anywhere\"RIP Kobe[removed][deleted]I\\'ve never watched an NBA game and still got a cold chill reading this - that man had impact. Jesus christ.His daughter now just confirmed passed awayLosing Neil Peart and Kobe just weeks apart after both had recently retired to spend time with their families is so sad. Two legends from 2 different worlds gone and we’re not out of the first month of 2020. Hug the ones you love and appreciate every moment you have people!Not a fan of basketball whatsoever but this guy was a legend. His daughter Gianna also passed which his incredibly sad. Rest easy 💔Some of you in this thread are fucked up.Helicopter... Of course...These things seem to crash constantly. I would never ride one ><RIP.[deleted]Out loud said \"No f---ing way\". RIPThe amazing part of this story is that TMZ has had the best reporting, better than the networks. RIP KOBEFirst the Australian bush fires, then the Coronavirus outbreak, now this?Man.. fuck 2020I\\'ve never been one for sports but seeing this news still shakes me. It really goes to show how much of a cultural impact he had.Reports are saying his 13yo daughter was also on board..What... the.... FUCK. This is not something I imagined seeing today.https://amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Apparently one of his daughters were among the victims of the tragedy.Never been a Lakers fan, but my God this is affecting.  I feel like I\\'ve grown up with him being the face of basketball for the longest time.  Obviously will go down as one of the greatest players in the game.  Thoughts are with the family.  This has me so shook.That’s terrible. I wasn’t a huge Kobe fan or anything but appreciated and recognized what the guy did for the game and the family he’s leaving behind. How tragic. Hopefully he’s just stepping out of the spotlight to live as a fisherman named Rory B. Bellows somewhere. RIP MambaEverytime you’d shoot a paper ball into a bin you’d scream Kobe! He’s iconic and will be rememberedBasketball is dead to me now 😢All the gold given to this thread... does that mean those people are happy he died?That\\'s so sad. And his daughter too. I\\'m heartbroken and speechless. Rip #goat #legendWhat\\'s up with the mod sticky? Was anyone making fun of him dying? I mean, did he do something bad to warrant that?Didn’t know his daughter Gianna was also on board. Fuck. This is depressingI say \"Kobe\" every time I try to throw something in a garbage can, and I don\\'t even watch basketball. A definite household name.Kobe Bryant will be missed. My condolences to his family.Yeah, 2020 sucks so far guys.I was never the biggest basketball fan, although I was always a fan of Kobe. A man so integral to the growth of a sport belongs on everyone\\'s list as a great human. His passion was contagious. He is true legend, and legends live forever.even if you hate kobe, his wife just lost her husband and oldest child, and her surviving children lost their father and sister (two people the youngest child will never know).  try not to be assholes.My condolences to his familyand his daughter. Christ that is just a terrifying way to go.Just heard his 13 year old was with him. Cant imagine the pain the mother is going through rn. Sending so much love to herInstead of yelling Kobe when we throw something we gotta yell “f” now 🥺Shit, I read the headline and I thought I was in some troll subreddit. This is crazy.Unreal. Is it confirmed yet? I’ve seen sources saying both “rumored”, “confirmed” and “false”.So this is sad news but it only deserves about 30 minutes of coverage, there are much more pressing things going on.What the fuck is up with some of these awards?  5 people died.  Grow up.His daughter got killed in the incident too, she was only 13.[removed]Lots of shitty people on here, damn.Illuminati did it.   Why else kill him now when he\\'s at the top.Not many sports superstars climb into the collective conscious like Kobe did. I’m honestly stunned.[deleted]This is the shit that makes me salty, who are the other people that died in the crash?This is so sad. I was just outside and people were crying on the streets. Just terrible.I was in the grocery store a bit ago and someone was going around saying this to literally anyone who would say anything.I\\'ve never watched sports but this sucks.  Hopefully his soul finds peace.2020 getting worse by the day. Rip legendThere are reports saying his 13 year old daughter also died in the crash. What the fuck, this is horrible.Kobe Bryant lived life to the fullest. What he accomplished in 20 years few can accomplish in their life. He was a good father and a role model for so many. His death brings tears to my eyes. May we all appreciate the preciousness of life a little more and give a moment of silence to commemorate him. Life isn\\'t fair, but it\\'s all we got. Rest in peace Kobe.He was on his way to his daughters game. So heartbreaking to find out he died with his daughter.Not even getting to be a memory for one of your children is one of the worst things I can imagine.At least he made the most out of his short lived life. RIP Black Mamba  😔wow what the fuck that\\'s awful[removed]He was one of the good guys.. not a saint, but he tried to make the world a better place.Nobody becomes the best at their job by accident. Twenty straight years and he was the best on the court until his knees gave way. He was still busy crushing the dreams of lord knows how many young players in his late thirties. Keeping yourself in peak physical condition while systemising millions of ways to break your opponent\\'s defense for twenty long years takes an insane amount of sheer intelligence and discipline. Athletes like Bryant only come around once in a blue moon. But he only got three years to see what the world is like outside of the glitzy, hyperactive cultural bubble of the NBA. Three years is nothing. Better than one year and even two but it\\'s still nothing. This headline doesn\\'t seem real. You\\'d think Kobe Bryant would live forever, but we keep forgetting how damn fragile life is. One helicopter ride on a weekend and it\\'s all over.2020 hasn’t got off to a great start for the basketball community. Former NBA commissioner David Stern on the 1st Jan and just yesterday the only Scottish player to play in the NBA passed away too and now this 😭I never get why people get on helicopters and small airplanes.They have the highest crash rating.If I had loads of money living the dream I would stay far away from them.Hell I do now and I\\'m not even rich.I value life to much.I didnt like basketball or know much about the games or palyers. My family watched and would talk about the players all the time. Debating James and Bryant and Jordan and the like. I dunno really what makes a player good. Or why. I often would watch Lebron and think he didnt seem that good, he just big and shoves people around. Kobe was the only player that i, as someone who didnt really know better, thought \"Wow that dude is good.\" Sucks to hear this today. Not a fan, but respected nontheless. Rip.Such a sad day. Love to Kobe’s family and friends.[deleted]Its a shame how many sports stars have lost their lives due to helicopter crashes.[deleted]What is going on lately... RIP KobeIt was also confirmed that his daughter Gianna was also killed in the crash.Gigi his 13 year old daughter also died on their way to a practice at Mamba Academy according to TMZ and EspnI can\\'t do 2020 anymoreDamn it feels so surreal knowing the time of his death. People can die at any given momentAccording to TMZ sources that his daughter was onboard too, god I hope thats not true..Daughter is being reported dead (13 year old daughter)Almost 30 y/o bird, S-76B, operated by Island Express, out of Van Nuys.

My heart aches for the families.i don\\'t even follow basketball but have always heard his name. don\\'t have to follow the NBA to know he was an incredible athlete. this makes me sick. life is fragile and doesn\\'t care who you are.He\\'ll be immortalized and his legacy will live on. RIP Kobe.Washington Post has been live streaming the crash site for over an hour on YouTube. It’s gross and incredibly disrespectful to his family and fans. They should be embarrassed....His 13 yr old died with him so tragic , prayers to the family[removed]2020 is going pretty well so far...I’m no sports fan, but I knew who Kobe was. And how important he was to so many. Just devastating to hear.I feel like the same shocked feeling as when michael jackson diedThis type of news makes you think that no matter who you are, you never know when your time will come. Not money, fame, nor popularity will save you from such a catastrophic event. I’ve had a loss recently and it made me just appreciate the moments you really have on this planet. It puts life in perspective and I hope this not just be a news article but a way for people to enjoy the moments they have with their family and loved ones. Go out and explore, do shit, make memories.Dude I literally can’t even believe it.  He was so alive and energetic.  Damn.  I guess 2020 is not gonna be such a good year.His 13 year old daughter was also on board 🙁We should change \"Kobe\" to \"~~To~~ For Kobe\" when trying to make a shot.Not a good start to 2020.2020 already off to a shitty start, can\\'t believe it.RiP Kobe Bryants daughter as well...I don’t even watch sports but damn this sucks RIP KobeWhy are you so shitty 2020?The Report is that Gianna was on board with another player and parent. They were on the way to a mamba academy game.I like to say something in this comment but I’m just lost for wordsDang his daughter was also on the helicopter.People on here saying he raped someone, but she didn\\'t want to testify in court. People easily forget innocent until proven guilty,  but fuck justice right?Details on flight and path.https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n72ex#23a8271eApparently there is a text Fox News is sharing with the staff about huge news about someone else on board.  They aren’t mention the name but seem to be very troubled by itHis thirteen year old daughter Gianna (Gigi) Bryant was also on the helicopter with him. They were headed to the Mamba academy when the helicopter crashed.[confirmation from TMZ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/)I now fully understand how Brazil felt in 94. RIP legend2020 sucks pretty bad so farThis is one of those things that really makes you think about your own mortality. Like damn, this hits hard and I was never a huge Kobe/Lakers fan. RIP.What the fuck, this is the first celebrity death that I can’t understand. What.Heard his 13 yo daughter also died in the crash...Hope it’s not trueJust popped up on my phone that his 13 year old daughter was on the plane. This is fucked...I\\'ve never watched a single NBA game through in my life, and this still hurts because I know what he meant to so many people, and how amazing and accomplished he was, and was still a stand up guy despite the fame and notoriety.Apparently, he was with his 13 year old daughter on their way to her basketball game.  Absolutely tragic.Why did someone give this a made me smile awardRIP to the man who got my watching basketballOkay I\\'m going to cry myself to sleep now. Never met him, he probably did not know I exist but he\\'s the reason I love the game of basketball. I\\'m literally in tears.[deleted]Of all people to die in a helicopter accident.Now ima be sad when I shoot trash from a distance with the fade saying \"KOBE!!\"[removed]This is almost impossible to process, I still can\\'t really believe it.He was the very reason I took basketball more seriously. The way he played was absolutely gorgeous and the dedication and work he committed to this game was insane. RIP Kobe Bryant. What a legend.His daughter GiGi was in the helicoper aswell 😢Kobe Bryant=5Calabasas=5He was 41yrs old=5He was killed with 4 others=5He was taking his daughter Gianna to a travel basketball game. Fuck today.I\\'ve often wondered sometimes how it must feel for past generations that have seen monumental figures in entertainment or sports lost at young ages, then having to refer to them in the past tense whenever talking about their accomplishments. Now I know, and it fucking sucks. From a Celtics fan, rest in peace Kobe, rest in peace Mamba.This celebrity death hits different. I’m sorry if this sounds stupid but this feels like the 9/11 of celebrity deaths imo. Sorry if that sounds like an ignorant statement and I mean no disrespect but no news has struck me in such a way like this since 9/11[deleted]Kobe highlights all day.I did not expect to feel this bad. RIP to one of the greatsHis 13 year old daughter died in the crash also.This is one of the few deaths that genuinely feels like a personal one.

I can’t imagine how bad that guy feels right now.[removed]This is one of those headlines you don\\'t believe, and you wonder what Shenanigans is Reddit up to now...I dismissed this at first thinking this was just one of those false celebrity death rumors on Facebook but damn, its actually real. Not a fan of basketball, but this guy was a hero to many. A household name even to those who don\\'t watch the sport. In school, whenever someone went for a paper toss to the bin, they\\'d shout out \"Kobe!\" Even found myself doing the same thing.[deleted]I don’t follow sports much but this is just heartbreaking!!!I heard some of the other passengers were his kids. Please say it isnt so.I am a clippers fan but i still like kobe bryant, and this makes me sad41 years old. Thats way too young[deleted][removed]That\\'s sad. Heard he was doing great things.

Sad 😥[removed]A true basketball legend...my heart hurts.I\\'m not too familiar with him, but ripHis 13 year-old daughter was also onboard it seems.At 2:35 or so, millions of people around the world got text messages from their friends simply saying, “Kobe.” That’s how great this guy was.TMZ has reported that Kobe\\'s daughter was also on the helicopter.

I know thoughts and prayers is a meme at this point, but I truly wish nothing but peace for his wife and 3 other children.god fucking damnit.. fuck this decade frForeign news outlets are saying his second oldest daughter was with him. Has anyone heard this? God, I hope it\\'s wrong.This is crazy, I hope the rest of the kids weren’t on the helicopter also. The mom would have lost 4 of the 5 kids along with her husband in a single day.Just goes to show that death doesn\\'t wait for anyone.

Died too youngHundreds murdered in Chicago every year, kids in Yemen being bombed, but the country stops because a basketball player dies. I don\\'t mean to downplay his death, but I kind of don\\'t care given how ridiculous priorities are.His daughter Ganiva died too at age 13His 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, also died in the crash. RIPIt\\'s crazy when someone you watched nearly your entire life, someone you thought was basically immortal, dies. Love had no personal impact on myself, but this was a blow I didn\\'t ever expect tbh.His 13 year old daughter among the victims, as well. So sad.His daughter was with him. Can’t imagine what his wife is going through right nowPeople saying horrible shit really gotta reevaluate what they’re doing, man. What truly drives y’all to be that way?Never going to be the same as you yell “Kobe” while throwing your Grenade in csgo.2020 isn’t getting any betterThis year has truly begun in a terrible shitty way.[deleted]2020 man. This years looking like it will be quite shit.I cant believe this. I\\'ve been a So Cal resident my whole life, and I have looked up to Kobe since I was very young. I cant imagine him going, or even his little girl Gianna dying aswell.

Really really bad.A friend of a friend works for TMZ and he just told my wife that Kobe\\'s daughters were with him. If true, that makes it even more tragic.His oldest daughter was with him :([removed]He was one of the greatest athletes of his generation and was as driven off the court as on it. This is a big loss for both the basketball and sporting community. RIPIf you have the chance, take 5 minutes to watch his Oscar winning short Dear Basketball.

My heart is breaking right now for Vanessa Bryant.There was a death hoax involving him 2 days ago, making this even more eerie.That one dude who gave the \"Made me smile\" award is bruh[deleted][deleted]Damn, what a heartbreaking news to wake up to.

You’ll be missed.From what I heard his daughter was on board with him as they were heading to a basketball game. How tragically sad.they are saying Kobe, his daughter gianna, gianna\\'s teammate and the teammates father was on board[removed][deleted]I’m not a big basketball guy but everyone would shout his name when throwing shit, I hope that speaks for how his legendary skill transcends just sports and made him a pop culture icon. It’s surreal that he went so young and so suddenly.At least one of his daughters was involved with the crash.https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/his 13-year-old daughter was also in the helicopter and passed away. so terrible.Sad shit.

So sadDaughter Gianna was 13, also died in crashI heard his 13 year old daughter was with him??? Any confirmation on that?Neil Peart, Terry Jones, Kobe.  That\\'s 3 right? can we stop now?When your name is synonymous with dunking, even outside of the basketball court, you know you\\'re a legend. Rest in peace, Kobe.Aside from Russell and Jordan, the most insanely competitive NBA player I ever saw.  Yes, he was athletically gifted, but that’s not what made him great;  willpower drove his genius.  No matter how many decades they name an “NBA all time top 50” Kobe will always be on that list.  For me, the only comparable shock from sport would be Earnhardt’s crash at Daytona.Was it the daughter that all the sports channels had clips of him talking to at a basketball game a few weeks ago?News Anchor already being racist. What a world we live in. [I’ll leave this here. ](https://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhF6JCrLY8MowoO5aC)You fake-woke losers spouting the BuRn In HeLl RaPiSt narrative need to do some fucking reading. It’s cut and dry fact Kobe did no such thing. Fucking ignorant, shameful cunts the lot of you. Save your ire for the deviant monsters who actually did what they’re accused of, like Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby.A cultural icon died alongside his daughter and colleagues. This is a massive tragedy. Act better you fucking charlatans.This is still very hard to believe... I\\'m in shockDamn. It’s crazy to think if he was sick and had to cancel whatever plans he had to travel by helicopter, he might still be here.Truly one of the greatest of all time, Rest In Peace Kobe.ESPN reporting his 13 year old daughter with him in the crash.  They were on the way to a travel basketball game with another player and her parent. Just heartbreaking.Looked up to him since I was in school playing in the basketball team :(Here\\'s an update from TMZ, news is worse than before:https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Watching the pro bowl and they said it was reported his oldest Daughter was on the plain with another player and parent of that player on their was to the girls game.Just now confirmed his daughter 13 was on the helicopter with her father.Jesus fuck man. This is unreal.Growing up, there was no one but him. This is the worst day in sports history. I’m shocked. I’ve been crying ever since everything has been confirmed. Kobe was my role model. I looked up to him. I wore his shoes, watched his games. I’m sick to my stomach. Without Kobe, I wouldn’t love the game as much. I’m just lost for words.His kid Gianna was on it as well. RipReports are now that his 13yr old daughter was with him and a another parent and player on daughter\\'s team. All headed to a practice in thousand oaks. Sad sad sad.The ultimate fade-away. This hurts. so. bad.I get that anonymity breeds boldness, but some of these comments are just awful.TMZ is reporting his 13 year old daughter was also onboard. They were heading to Kobe’s basketball academy.[deleted]His daughter Gianna has also been confirmed to be one of the casualties [twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/CarmenMB_Fox10/status/1221537358761250816)Never watched NBA/basketball but i knew Kobe and who he was.

I’ve looked but everything is just Kobe, and some say Kobe and 1 daughter. Are they trying to figure that out and ID the others?[deleted][deleted]https://i.redd.it/8wgnuah4c2d41.jpgWhen I saw that shirt earlier. I took a good look at it and felt uneasy. Like something is wrong. I closed it right away. Then this happened. Fuck. I feel bad. We will miss you Kobe. I feel broken. 😭I just heard his 13 year old daughter was on the flight with him and passed as wellAny truth to this?[removed]my pilot instructor is teaching a helicopter pilot who knew the pilot on board.  He\\'s saying the cloud ceiling was really low in Calabasas today. They lost situational awareness and flew into terrain.Simply hearsay but just wanted to share. RIP the goat.  He was an inspiration to everyone, basketball fan or not. FHis 13 yo daughter was in the chopper with him 😭 I really hope his wife and kids make it through this.

Just devastatingRIP, he was a great player. Really sad to hear about this.Reports saying his younger daughter was on the helicopter tooI\\'m so heartbroken... Growing up as a dumb kid, I didn\\'t really look up to people or anything like that. One day my older brother was watching basketball and I was hearing about a 17 year old possibly getting drafted. Ever since I noticed a young kid got into the NBA at 18 years old my whole perspective in life changed. I looked up to Kobe like he was my own older brother or father. I\\'ll never forget him, I love you brother, rest in piece Black Mamba.RIP. Interesting to note none of the social media teams representing the 4 teams playing right now have said a peep about the games. Everyone apart from Adam Silver and shareholders know these players would be better off allowed to grieve in peace.Rip to the greatest ever :(Damn this might be the first celebrity death to really hit me hard.One of the 5 people that died was his daughter. Fucking tragic, obviously you never expect to hear news like this but it doesn’t even seem realIs there any confirmation regarding his daughters? It is all over social media that his daughter died too?Kobe, his daughter Gianna, a teammate, one of the teammate parent, and the pilot, on the way to a gameWas not expecting this at all :(Ngl, I absolutely want to down vote this into oblivion because this makes me so sad y\\'allRIP legeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeend[TMZ now confirming at least one of his daughters was on board with him.](https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/)apparently one of his daughters died with him too, she was 13Daughter was in the accidentA real shame, another champion taken by a helicopter crash, Colin McRae died in 2007 while piloting his private helicopter.Allison Morris has just inadvertently destroyed her career.I don\\'t even follow basketball like how I used to when I was a teenager, but what a lost for the sport worldwide. I\\'d be lying if I said Kobe didn\\'t impact me to get a hoop out in the driveway or to play NBA live, he is such a legend.His last tweetContinuing to move the game forward @KingJames.

May you and your young daughter rest in peace, Kobe. Rest in peace to the other passengers as well. :(Saw someone hold up a RIP Kobe Bryant sign at the Leipzig Major and didn\\'t understand it. Brushed it off as some kind of reference to a hero in DOTA2... didn\\'t even consider Kobe had actually died.RIP to the people that died from Coronavirus tooEarly morning in LA area was really misty/foggy weather. I wonder if it was controlled flight into terrain. I kinda hope so.

One day on my ride home from work, I was sitting at a red light when this tinted out black car pulls up next to me. I look over and the car\\'s window is going down and the gentleman in the car throws some small wrapper out on the ground. I make eye contact with the guy and he gives me a head nod and I think \"damn, he looks just like Kobe.\" The window goes back up and pulls off when the light turns green. The license plate was KOBE 24. That was the day I saw Kobe Bryant litter. RIP Kobe.I’d like to think that he’d want us to keep saying ‘Kobe!’ But now it should mean ‘Everything negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise’ - Kobe Bryant.One of his daughters killed too.

For secret santa, one guy on our department got a colleague a mini basketball hoop and tiny inflatable ball. We\\'ve spent weeks shouting \"KOBE!\" while taking shots.This is why I don\\'t like helicopters, EVERYTHING is dependent on these little propellers continuously spinning.

RIPIf your a talented ANYTHING.. STOP FLYING IN HELICOPTERS. STOPITNOWStory keeps changing from legitimate news agencies:* His eldest daughter was also on-board and killed.* All four of his daughters were also on-board and killed.* Rick Fox was on-board and killed.All in the last 30 minutes. Ridiculous. Is journalism basically ambulance chasing now? **Stop putting out unverified information, you slimy fucks.**Anyway, really tragic. Not even a basketball fan, but no denying the man\\'s record-breaking contributions to the sport, and will always be one of the GOATs.I\\'m very interested in the cause, as a former helicopter mechanic. Mechanical failure likelihood is low, but not impossible. Pictures I\\'ve seen from the crash site show low visibility - overcast and foggy - and may have been pilot error (not to blame the dead). May have hit a downdraft or a pocket of air, or found itself in a vortex ring state, that didn\\'t allow them to get any lift.RIP to his daughter and everyone else tooThe writers for this year really suckFuck man. Can\\'t be real. RIP .TMZ is also reporting his 13 year old daughter, Gianna, was onboard.https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Small amateur run airplanes and helicopters scare the shit out of me. Very sadUnpopular opinion: Everyone except his kids is probably better off for it. He was part of the NBA\\'s ties to China. He slept around on his wife. He raped a woman. He sold overpriced shoes to underprivileged kids.Was he still a rapist? I know the case was dropped because of a refusal to testify but reddit was so convinced by the DNA evidence at the time and anytime his name came up it was rape,now everyone is sad. Which is it guys?TMZ confirming one of his daughters was onboard.Horrendous news[removed]The day after LeBron passes him as all-time scorer? I aint saying they\\'re connected.... but it certainly is fishy.One of his daughters, Gigi, confirmed dead. :\\'( MY KOBE WHY... T\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_TActually just read an update his 13 year old daughter Gianna was also on board and killed.I just found out his daughter “Gigi” was on board as well. She was only 13Just unreal and so sad.  Prayers to his familydo we know what happened to the helicopter to cause the crash yet?Damn, he isn\\'t even in any death pool I\\'ve ever seen.Just confirmed one of his daughters was on board, Gianna Maria aka GiGi. That hurts to hear. May their family get through this.I heard about it while watching football and they showed the spot that looked like the crash, is he confirmed deceased? And his children?This \"reporting\" is a shit show. No family, 4 daughters, 3 daughters, 1 daughter, Rick Fox, no Rick Fox, no family. Come on...My heart sunk not one second after clicking all. I feel bad for his family. RIP KB.I dont really enjoy Basketball but I knew who he was nonetheless and I know he inspired many people.RIP Kobe. Gone too soon.[removed]TMZ just reported that reps for Kobe confirmed his daughter Gianna was also on boardLots of pieces of shit in this thread.His 13 year old daughter Gianna was reportedly killed too.Wife and 4 (5?) kids are safe, I just hope they don\\'t spend the next decade in a legal battle with the family of the others who were lost. What happens in this situation? If the investigation comes back A-OK on the helicopters condition, is he held liable?Edit - down voted for asking a theoretical question, niceThis is horrible, i could see the smoke from my house before i found out it happened, i can\\'t believe thats what i was seeing.From TMZ:12:35 PM PT -- Kobe\\'s daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.We\\'re told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.Uh, now I\\'m seeing reports of his 13 year old daughter was there, too???One of the two reasons I began to love the game. What he did for the game itself and how he continued to support players after he left the game speaks to his character. RIP to a legend.I\\'m feeling sorry for his daughter, but this rapist ass deserved it. He was charged with sexual assault and karma finally got to him.This was not something I expected to read everI’m ballin’ tonight - zero question.My brother and I grew up watching Kobe together. He\\'s the player who got me interested in basketball in the first place. I\\'m absolutely crushed. I can\\'t believe this is real. I hope to God his daughters weren\\'t on board.Looks like at least one of his daughters was on the helicopter heading to a basketball camp according to a few articlesThis is the first celebrity death thats fucked me up a bit he had so much life left damn.Such a legend in the NBA... his wife and family and also Pau Gasol are heart broken rn... May God have his soul rest in peace.Gianna his daughter was also on board. Damn. It keeps getting worse. RIP[deleted]Daughter on board https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Times like these remind us of how fragile life is. I send my best to his family and friends.I pay my respects for him, the other four victims, and the families of those involved.So sad. I feel terrible for his familyThis is a fucking wake up call. We all need to live in the moment. Who knows when our time is up...omfg...Wish all the strength and support for their family.RIP legend.I can\\'t remember ever being so utterly gob-smacked by an athlete\\'s death before, just absolutely devastating. I  watched his whole career, from back when he had the afro and his old number in \\'96. It wasn\\'t just that he was *better* than almost everyone else on the floor when he played, but he always seemed *smarter* too, more savvy.He was probably my favorite athlete who ever played any sport. What a terrible tragedy, my prayers are with his family.Here you can see the flightpath: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/n72ex#23a8271eFeb 3, 1959, the day the music died. Jan 26, 2020, the day the game died.\"...I can\\'t remember if I cried  When I read about his widowed bride  Something touched me deep inside  The day the music died  SoBye, bye Miss American Pie...\"who else was ACTUALLY in the helicopter because everything is just rumorsThe worst of all this is the reports that has daughters were on board...they had yet to reach their potential :-(So sad and shocking. An absolute legend. RIP Kobe.Rest In Paradise legendI am terrified of helicoptersWhat was the pilot thinking taking off under foggy conditions?!Holy fuck. This was unexpected. Rest in peace, Kobe.Damn i was shooting hoops yesterday and i kept saying \\'Kobe\\' when i was shooting deep and i thought it was gonna go. Rest in peaceNot even a basketball fan, or even a sports fan in general, but my father has been a Lakers fan for many years and Kobe seemed like an awesome person. This put a damper on my day.RIPKobe was one of the basketball players I grew up watching and hearing this news is devastating. My thoughts go out to his family.Well, this is a shit birthday.I\\'m gonna go play NBA live 2005 and cryRip to a legend<3Speechless a great talent of our generation has passed so young. Simply speechless.Kobe you might be dead, but your legacy will live forever! Prayers to your familyAnd ofc prayers to the family who also lost a part of them :(I’ll always remember him as an under aged teenager that came to my bar in a nightclub in LA not long after signing with the Lakers. I remember being nervous that he would order a drink and I’d have to be in the uncomfortable position of carding him, knowing he was under 21.  At the time we had some other out of control under aged celebs that created drama (Leo DeCaprio I’m talking to you) When Kobe got to the bar, he ordered an Evian.[My wife tried finding my autographed jersey but could only find this](https://imgur.com/gallery/jP5TpwM)[removed]Man. I don\\'t follow sports but as a Leicesterian this reminds me of the awful tragedy which happened in my city in 2018. And I don\\'t really know Kobe Bryant either but he seemed like a good bloke and god I really really hope none of his children were on board. Fuck helicopters, seriously.Rip to a legend I pray for his family and friends this is a very sad day for sports regardless of who you are or where you’re from.Absolute Baller and Lakers Legend. RIP big man!Im sure a lot of us brits don\\'t know anything about basketball but im certain most of us know who Kobe is. This is like the equivalent of David Beckham dying for us brits. This is huge news that will sadden people all around the world. Im sorry for your loss, especially to all the Lakers fans. Tragic news man.And i have never trusted helicopters. i wouldn\\'t get in one if you paid me. The billionaire Leicester City FC chairman died not too long ago from a helicopter crash. At least with a plane you could maybe glide back to earth, but a helicopter is pretty much fucked if you have mechanical problems They\\'ve always scared the crap out of me.[removed]TMZ is now reporting his 13 year old daughter Gianna was also on board. They were heading to basketball practice. Tragic.That\\'s so horrible and sudden.Who were the other 4 in the copter?Omg his daughter was on the helicopter with him.This month is just the worst. RIP.Even speaking as someone who doesn\\'t watch basketball much, it still hurts to hear this happened \\\\*\\\\*at only 41\\\\*\\\\*.And just after Lebron broke his all-time point record. Such cruel irony :(My dad was killed in a helicopter crash a few years ago.  It\\'s such a life-altering experience.  I grieve so much for his wife and all she\\'ll be going through.Edit: Thank you for the Platinum.  I\\'m humbled by all the kindness and words of support.His eldest daughter was in the helicopter with him.His daughter Gianna was also on boardTmz is saying his 13 year old daughter was also killed in the crash.As we age, we will be witnessing a lot of famous and personal deaths. I lost 2 grandparents on both sides just this month. All i can say is, try to establish peace with yourself for the days you are alive. We all will leave one day.Okay..time to just throw 2020 straight into the trash..fuuuck..One thing that really gets me about this is that so many fans will say they feel for the family, but no, many of them don\\'t give a damn. They will continue to use him and his career as a talking point.\"Dear Basketball\" hurts even more now.The restaurant I was in went silent when the news broke on cable TV.I\\'d love to cross check all the people here defending his sexual assault accusation with anything posted on politics (Trump, Kavenaugh, Clinton)It sure feels like the people we like only deserve the benefit of the doubt.R.I.P. Kobe.Life is so weird with patterns and such. Not only the timing of LeBron passing him in scoring... but also me personally. I made a HUGE decision on Friday (1/24) that changed the life of a man for the rest of his life. Biggest decision I\\'ve ever made in my life. \"One of a citizen\\'s greatest duties\" as they call it.. I was certain in my decision, but not absolutely certain. Just strange that I made the decision on the 24th. And then Kobe (#24) dies two days later. Really sad.How fragile life is. This guy had all the money in the world and was incredibly healthy/fit. Boom, snuffed out just like that. Really makes you think.[deleted]13 year old daughter also killed.The Black Crusaders strike again.Life is fucking weird man.Honestly it\\'s sad a legend died. It\\'s even sadder his daughter passed with him. Rip Gianna as well ...Poor wife and the kids. Must be scarred. I wish them the bestI’m in complete shock. Kobe Bryant was mine and most people’s favourite player growing up. My thoughts are with all of those who lost their lives and the families affected by this terrible tragedy. 😢💛Any idea who is the other passengers?His 13 year old daughter was on board as well. They were going to basketball practice... such a tragedy.FUCKKKK One of his daughters was on board Rest In Peacehttps://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/This is unimaginable. I can’t believe this happened. An inspiration to millions has died.[deleted]Hope his daughters are all right. RIP.Was never a Lakers fan (Celtics fan so I rooted against the Lakers by default) but I always respected his skill and work ethic.  The world lost a true legend today.  RIPAlso remember that other families are affected by this tragedy also.  They may not have had anyone famous on board but they still lost someone.Updates are showing his 13 year old daughter was in the helicopter as well. So sad.TMZ reported that, “Gianna Maria was amongst those who died in the accident.”Im not sure why I feel so bad about this but I do.This is absolutely heart breaking, but now they are saying his children were on board.TMZ says his oldest daughter was in the crashOne of his daughters was with him as well according to some reports coming out. Incredibly sad.TMZ just reported one of his daughters was also in the crash! 😢Kobe barely got to enjoy retirement.https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/1221533868433592320?s=19Can we just restart 2020? Don\\'t keep this save neither.When I saw the notification that nfl players paid respects to Kobe and it said he passed I felt my heart just drop man. Kobe was one of the greatest and will be remembered as the greatest. RIP to this legend he will never be forgotten.ugh:https://www.businessinsider.com/kobe-bryant-steve-blake-helicopter-2012-11\"Kobe\\'s helicopter is well documented. He takes it from his home in Orange County to games at the Staples Center so he doesn\\'t have to sit in two hours of traffic.According to a 2010 GQ profile, Kobe sees it as more of a piece of fitness equipment than a luxury:\"But sexy as it might seem, Bryant says the helicopter is just another tool for maintaining his body. It\\'s no different than his weights or his whirlpool tubs or his custom-made Nikes. Given his broken finger, his fragile knees, his sore back and achy feet, not to mention his chronic agita, Bryant can\\'t sit in a car for two hours. The helicopter, therefore, ensures that he gets to Staples Center feeling fresh, that his body is warm and loose and fluid as mercury when he steps onto the court.\"He is the NBA\\'s highest-paid player this year at around $27 million, and he has made more than $220 million just in salary during his 17-year NBA career. So he can afford it.\"He had done so much in his 41 years, not only for the sport of Basketball but by being a great Father to his children. RIP to the real legend Kobe Bryant 👏This is scary to me. He seemed like a very good person.I can\\'t believe Koby passedRip goat, he’s changed the basketball and every sportJesus Christ man. If the first month of 2020 is any indicator on how the rest of this year is going to go, we’re fucked.[deleted]I can\\'t still believe that, it\\'s hearth-wrenching.For those who don\\'t really follow basketball, I encourage you to watch the  legendary final moments of [Kobe\\'s last game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y64OsZNYhp0).I Don’t have a lot with basketball, but this shocked me a lot!![deleted]We’re not even out of January yet and 2020 already sucks fucking ballsHeartbreaking. Rest In Peace Mamba 😢Man even Twitter has crashed, can’t load any tweets![deleted]It is confirmed that one of his daughters was on board too.  Rip[removed]This is crazy. I honestly can’t believe it, a childhood legend of mine. I hope his family and loved ones are doing ok, that’s so sudden.It\\'s been 20 minutes since i read this headline and i honestly still cannot believe the thread i\\'m in right now.Tmz reports his daughter Gigi was on the flight toohttps://amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/?__twitter_impression=trueFuck. This can’t be true. Please someone tell me this is not real. Can’t be.I think it was on Kimmel, but Kobe did an interview where he was bragging about always taking helicopters everywhere. Never having to get into LA traffic...Damn, TMZ now reporting that Kobe\\'s 13 yr old daughter was also on board.TMZ is now reporting that his 13 year old daughter Gianna was on board with him and also died.

What the eff 2020????LA royalty.  As a Los Angeles native, this one cuts so deeply.  RIP Mamba.One of the GOATs. It was really special to have seen him play.  So sad that he is gone.  That being said....black mambas are not flying snakes.....Charlotte Hornets great Kobe Bryant /sReally, this is fucking terrible. Prayers to his family.This is unbelievably tragicanyone else feel like they\\'ve lived more than five years in the first month of 2020?the world should get off this January rideAs someone who was born and raised in LA , played ball because I saw the lakers win the 2010 (or 2009?) finals , broke my foot , never touched on the court again. I did it all because of Kobe , Rest In Peace. Losing too many people this is truly sadIve been on the phone with various friends since this came out...everyone was saying the same thing that its the first time we\\'ve felt actual sadness that a celebrity diedWhat a tragedy if his daugters were there too. R.I.P. Black Mamba.TMZ confirms 13 year old daughter on boardThis is so surreal. I have read the title a couple of times... It just isn\\'t registering in my brain.[removed]Can someone please fucking tell me none of his family was onboard, with certainty?? Fucking ABC News is out here floating the notion that his daughters were with him..Anyone got anything???God fucking dammit.This man will be sorely missed. RIPRIP, this shit is so fucked manHis wiki page is already updated with date of death. Wow. Too fast. Too shocking.How much do you wanna bet that everybody who didnt like him before adores him nowLiterally was just watching a film on him... Shocking.[removed]Rip to the legendary basketball GOD Kobe, regardless of what he may have done off the court. I’m sure he was a great husband and father. Put aside whatever he may have, or may not have done off the court, and show respect as another human being who did so much for basketball, minorities, and giving back to the city. Sending my love and condolences to the Bryant family, May God rest Kobe’s soul. EDIT: RIP GIGI. 13 years old and she’s gone. Tragic.Why is it that everyone who is wealthy and have their life completely under control end up dead.What’s the difference between Kobe and time? Time passesJust watched Dear Basketball right now for the first time damn! Gonna miss you Black Mamba! One of the greatest sports personalities and athletes of all time. RIP Kobe.Did I miss something? I get he\\'s extremely famous but the reaction to this is so huge I feel like I\\'m missing somethingI never cry over famous deaths, but today the tears are flowing. Rest in paradise Kobe.[Kobe\\'s daughter GiGi (Gianna, 13) also confirmed on board the helicopter and deceased.](https://amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/)Stay away from heli unless u Russian cuzhttps://twitter.com/dotNoso/status/268466325842694144?s=19Fuck 2020.

RIP Black Mamba.Didn\\'t care much for him but RIP.  He\\'s a year younger than me.I hope his family is ok.  I also hope he had presence of mind at some point to sit down with his children and let them know that he had lived a good, full life and for them not to be sad if something was to happen to him.  I had that talk with my daughters about a year ago.  It would still be hard for them though.Cannot believe this is real. Lost a legend just like that.2020 just started, wtf is happeningrip kobe man i feel sick this dude was a significant part of my childhoodeven his name kobe is never gonna be the same can\\'t even shout it after shooting anymoreAbsolutely heartbroken, grew up in LA watching him give me hope and inspiration. Can’t believe this RIP Mamba you will never be forgottenIts rumored his daughters were also in the helicopter.Damn. TMZ now reporting his eldest daughter was on board. It’s one thing to lose a husband, but a child? I can’t imagine what Vanessa is going through.The All Star weekend should now be a tribute event.What awful news. May he rest in peacei was named after this legend. i’ll always remember him, even if i was never a huge fan. rip mambaThat’s real sad when someone dies so before their time, Also I have never watched a NBA basketball game and sports are over rated.I\\'ll always remember his last game, RIP to a LEGENDIm not even from US and dont even watch basketball yet whenever I throw something I shouted \"Kobe\"! instead of \"Yeet\"!, so it is indeed a sad day for me..... Alexa play Despacito.They\\'re reporting now that his daughter GiGi was with him.  She\\'s the 13 year old pictures with him courtside in the beanie in a lot of the news stories today.This man was my inspiration, RIPhttps://www.radarbox24.com/data/registration/N72EXLooks like he retired with the HeatThis feels so surreal and I don\\'t even know why. People die in accidents all the time. But... Kobe?? Wow. RIPI hate that it had to be him :(Man i literally say Kobe everytime i throw something, now it\\'s gonna feel weird.To soon to say Lebron James is the greatest Laker alive?12:35 PM PT\\xa0--\\xa0Kobe\\'s daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.\\xa0We\\'re told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.TMZ confirmed his daughter Gianna was aboard too. Terrible. RIP.They just mentioned the passing of Kobe during the pro bowl. R.I.P.Wow...I’m speechless.A man that meant so much to me personally just...gone like that. Watching this man play basketball got me through some really tough times and the titles he brought to us made me and countless others happier than you could imagine. Thoughts with his family at this horrible time, especially his wife and 4 little girls.My favourite ever basketball player and the best I ever saw. R.I.P Mamba. Thank you for everything.Edit: Reports coming out that his daughter Gianna has also died in the crash. As if this wasn’t tragic enough.I\\'m an on-and-off NBA fan who really only follows the Jazz, so Kobe has always been just some vague \"basketball legend\" figure (and Oscar winner).Literally last night I saw his tweet congratulating LeBron for passing his scoring record and thought \"Well that\\'s so cool of him. Perfect example of game recognizing game.\"I know his list of basketball achievements is longer than I can even imagine, not to mention being a husband and father, but this is how I\\'ll remember him.RIP basketball legend.Rip kobe, my idiol hope he rests in peaceRIP black mamba, one of the all time greatsPlease keep in mind that in the hours after Michael Jackson died, there was all kinds of reports that turned out not to be true.  I\\'m not believing anything other than Kobe has died in a helicopter crash unless there\\'s an official statement.As a father, I hope his girls were not on that helicopter with him!Can’t wait for JayStation to FaceTime Kobe’s ghost at 3am 🙄2020 starting off strong as one of the worst years in a long timeWhat a tragedy, such a young guy. It was truly an honor to have seen him play. This is incredibly sad.Can we just go to 2021 already....I hate this. And I was never a Kobe fan, but god damn I respected him so much. RIP Mamba.TMZ reporting Kobe\\'s 13 year old daughter also killed in crash.https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Oh wow! My condolences to his family and fans!Rest in peace. I am in total disbelief.“Friends come and go but banners hang forever”Kobe my hero as a kid. I looked up to him and he inspired my love for Ball for the past 20+ years. I even named my dog after him. The man is a true legend who will be missed. So youngThis is a habit he picked up as a laker, he did this after he tore his Achilles because driving was going to cause too much strainWhy Kobe man, why Kobe.This is a habit he picked up as a laker, he did this after he tore his Achilles because driving was going to cause too much strainStunned at everyone acting like this guy was some kind of saint...He was a basketball player, serial cheater and rapist. Y’all are crazy.Was the other passengers his kids??This sounds awful, but please someone tell me that his parents have passed like ten years ago so they don\\'t have to bury their son.Such a sad day in history today. Strong and well wishes to Bryant’s wife.Reports that his daughters were on board.... fuckEdit: ABC retracted the report.  Probably not likely as 5 total people on boardThanks for the memories. Rest In Peace.His 13 year old daughter as well :([deleted]rip to the one of the greatest to ever do it, this is a shock: crazy.RIP to one of the greats.I never really followed basketball, but it\\'s a name everyone knows.I’m not liking 2020 so far.I just saw on Twitter that there where children on board.Please let this not be true[this guys](https://imgur.com/OUD55i9.jpg) shit post from 2012 in now going viral because he called out how Kobe was going to die.Don\\'t ever wish death on anybody.Sorry if I\\'m wrong but I swear when ABC cut in to the pro bowl they said something about his daughters being on board.Time to bring back the “Kobe” saying for the legendAnyone know what he was doing?Shooting garbage into the can and saying \"Kobe\" will not be the same. RIP Kobe. Such sad news...RIP Kobe, gone way, way too soon. Thoughts are with his family and the families of the others which passed away.I am absolutely speechless.The Live comments here make me literally sick to my stomach. Way too high a percentage of humans are sick fucks.Wow. Last thing I thought I would see when I started my colonoscopy prep bathroom hangout.LeBron James is going to be crushed. This is horrible. Of course his family, too. So tragic.No way. This is insane. I definitely cheered against Kobe as a player, but I also admired his drive and talent. It was nice to see him enjoying his retirement with his kids. This is devastating.God damn, man. can\\'t be true.I was buying a part for my car and the cashier went nuts when his phone buzzed.  He told everyone in the store and no one believed him.I\\'m just outside of LA and its been foggy all morning.  Very quiet and serene since I\\'m not far from all the smaller airports which would expect have grounded morning flights.  I\\'d hate to think that was a factor in this.My condolences for his friends, family and for all the fans.Kobe\\'s 13 year old daughter reportedly was in the helicopter as well :(His 30 for 30 will be an Oscar winner.[He narrated a short film that won an Oscar. RIP Kobe and the passengers.](https://youtu.be/ziUc0OCDmoU)Sorting by controversial and getting my popcorn.[deleted]Colin McRae did it betterI’m shocked.

Updates?This can’t be fucking realPlease note that there are multiple sources refuting claims that Rick Fox or Kobe\\'s daughters were on the helicopter. Best not to spread any potential rumors about that until they are confirmed.Edit: Sources seeming to confirm Rick Fox was not on the helicopter https://twitter.com/JaredSGreenberg/status/1221532759480512514https://twitter.com/ReignOfApril/status/1221532526092546049https://twitter.com/CourtneyFallon_/status/1221531721688068096TMZ is now reporting that one of his daughters was on the plane https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Not a bball guy, but a sports guy. This sucks the suckiest of sucks. I get it.This is so so sad. I grew up hating him as a warriors fan but as his career ended and he began doing more good things after he retired, I had nothing but the upmost respect for him. My wife and a lot of my friends are die hard Lakers fans and grew up watching him. He was LA. This is devastating.LA is in tears right now. Everyone who was born and raised in this city has been shook to the core. Every one of my friends and family can’t believe this. I don’t watch basketball and it has shaken me more than I can imagine. He was all over growing up, I can’t believe he’s gone and in such tragic way.One of the greatest athletes ever. Couldn\\'t be more sad this is such bad news 😢I remember him coming into the league, and all the expectations of him at such an early age.Kobe lived up to them all.  One of the greatest to ever playI have this weird thing where when I hear about plane crashes, I imagine what the final seconds of those peoples’ lives are like - what they’re thinking, saying, what their faces look like. It just makes me that much more sad but it always happens.Out of all the shit that has happened so far in 2020, this has got to be the single most unexpected piece of news I have seen.This year isn\\'t smiling with anybody. Just sad.What the fuck, I’m shookWatching Dear Basketball now has a whole different meaning.I think it\\'s unfortunate all that people care about is the passing of the player, not the rest of the passengers.jesus christ man this really hurts. the day after lebron passed him for 3rd all time scoring. wtf man :([This tweet from 2012 has me feeling some kind of way ](https://twitter.com/dotnoso/status/268466325842694144?s=21)felt sick to my stomach after reading this, can\\'t believe it\\'s real, really makes you think about your own problems and how insignificant they areI can’t get that feeling out of my stomach right now. This really hurtsDoesn\\'t feel real at all like he was my brothers favorite player and he literally called my mom to tell her, my brother never does that.Holy shit... I didn’t believe it when I first heard it, still seems kind of surreal. RIP Mamba[deleted]Yelling Kobe while tossing a frag in CoD will never feel the sameHe feels like one of those guys who had so much left to offer the world too. Damn 😔I don\\'t know shit about basketball, but this news absolutely shocked me, damn. The world\\'s lost a great sportsman today.Brink of war, Corona virus, Kobe Bryants death. It hasn\\'t even been a month into the year and it\\'s going to shit.Why would his 4 kids be with him and no wife.  I’m not buying itThis is devastating. I can’t help but be reminded of another helicopter crash that happened five years ago and killed French sailing legend Florence Arthaud, and French Olympic medalists Camille Muffat (a swimmer) and Alexis Vastine (a boxer), as well as 7 others. Sportsmen and women inspire us so much to believe in ourselves and others, and to go beyond ourselves; they make us hope and cry in joy and more than anything they make us feel like we BELONG, either to a team, a city, a country or even just a crowd of other fans. They are true stars and it is always so sad to see them go. RIP Kobe Bryant. Wherever you’re going now, you’ve got this.There’s reports all of his daughters might have been with him besides the youngest. Can anyone confirm that with a link?Five people died that day...fuck this hero worshipITT:You fucking pieces of shit downvoting the fact that 4 other people\\'s lives mattered just as much as his...Come talk to me when you lose someone who is actually close to you.This is sad and horrifying. Rest in peaceWhy are we sad a rapist, adulterer, and generally shitty person died?Sure, he was an incredibly talented player, but that doesn\\'t make up for being a shitty person.What a first month of the decade.Australia fires. Floods. Locust swarm in Africa. Iran usa war. Coronavirus. Kobe dead. And January isn\\'t even over yet.Wow reports are saying all 4 daughters were on the helicopter with him...Edit: Ok apparatantely the reports weren\\'t all daughters but 3 I think. But it has also been backpedaled now. That\\'s some really disgusting reporting to do as a huge news agency. Soulless.Wow super sad day for everyone in LATo think, not less than this morning was he alive... life\\'s scary manFuck man, I can\\'t remember the last time someone who was current passed away like this?  I\\'m not a huge basketball fan but I respected him and what he did. Can\\'t imagine what his family are going through. RIPDon’t sort by controversial.Kobe Bryant never raped anyone. The accuser wouldn\\'t even testify in court and the mattered was settled outside. The sex was consensual, the girl in question was just a ho trying to cash in a professional players seed. Get your facts straight people.January 2020: *Possible WW3*Devastating fires in Australia. Millions of animals die. * Coronavirus outbreak in China. Everybody in the world is scared. * One of the greatest of all time dies . Kobe Bryant. Rip Black Mamba. Let’s hope from now on this year bring us uplifting news.ABC News now *backpedaling* on report that his daughters were on the chopper....https://twitter.com/WPLGLocal10/status/1221531515961708544tips for living a long life: dont fly in helicopters, personal airplanes, ride motorcycles, cave dive, free dive, or ride scooters (in east asia)[deleted]Our ASD-B radar had been picking up all his flights for the past two weeks, but oddly, there is no log of this last flight. That’s very strange, but I suppose we’ll find out when they conduct the investigation.Well that\\'s not very cash money.[removed]Wait, saw this on Facebook and assumed it was some clickbait bullshit fake news....damnSome news outlets reporting that some of his daughters also died in the crash.[deleted][deleted]Man, it’s always fucking helicopter crashes all the time ffs“Mamba 4 Life” - Lebron JamesAn American icon without any doubt.  I’ve heard that his daughters were with him in the helicopter.  Horrifically, this will be one of if not the biggest tragedy in American sports history.[deleted]I haven’t been an NBA fan since the 90s however you can’t help but hear about Kobe’s on court accomplishments. Being one of the top scorers in NBA history is no small feat. I’m sure he’ll be missed by his fans.Kobe going in posthumously into the Hall of Fame is gonna hurt so bad. :([removed]Damn. Not a fan of basketball but RIP. Hope his family will be ok.Absolutely fucking insane. I didn\\'t believe it at first when TMZ was reporting it, but wow it\\'s confirmed. RIP Kobe! Condolences to his family.[deleted]Lots to unpack here. Yes he had a huge and transformative effect on basketball but he was also an unrepentant rapist and it\\'s important to be aware and thinking about both things.[deleted]Damn... 2020 has been a wild oneI\\'m absolutely gutted hearing this.  I\\'m in shock.Who were the other 4 people?I was just having a conversation with my girlfriend about Kobe yesterday, sad.ABC News is reporting that Bryant’s four daughters were also on board the helicopter.Thank you for all the memories. Rip Mamba.This is not how I pictured his chapter to end. RIP Mamba[deleted]To all of those saying “I feel bad for his daughters,” there’s a real chance his daughters were in the helicopter with him. That’s tough to consider.Donated huge amount of money to the public HS that he went to, towards the gym. He is a legend.How sad. All the fame and fortune and dies at 41.  Reminder to live each day.[deleted][deleted]I can’t believe this, I really hope his four children weren’t onboard. I can’t believe it.I was lucky enough to meet Kobe during a workshop for physically disabled children wanting to shoot some hoops.....he was such a REAL person unlike some of those in the industry. This is sad stuff indeed.In shock right now. Saw Kobe play his rookie year and was a big fan of his. RIP to a legend. Prayers to the Bryant family.Make 2020 stop please[deleted]We\\'ve had a lot of fog in SoCal over the past few days. I\\'m pretty far south of Calabasas but wonder if bad weather played a part. What a tragedy.Its kind of overcast and cloudy on the coast today.  Maybe not so great for helicoptering.I don’t know shit about basketball and even I find this shocking. Best wishes to his family.I never cared much for basketball, but damn, hearing this is nuts.Here is the report that I saw this morning. It didn’t mention Kobe at the first reports of the crash. https://go.citizen.com/lkHZauKwz3Edit: I don’t know why I’m being downvoted. You must be misunderstanding what I meant. What I am trying to say is that when the helicopter crash was first reported on the app, it didn’t mention Kobe. It later updated with that info once it became public. https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/helicopter-crash-sparks-brush-fire-southern-california-68544967I don’t even watch basketball but I’m shaken. I feel like he just had a big impact to culture in general, whether you’re a sports fan or not. Like every kid yelled “KOBE” at least once while throwing something away. I’m in shock.[removed]2020 doesn’t seem to be off to a good start[removed][deleted]The new decade is fucked, goddamn.I’m so fucking numb right now.Seems weird that relaying the news that someone is dead should get so many awards.Damn, I never thought someone’s death that I never met would be this sad :(( R.I.P A LEGENDI was looking this up and some sites are reporting his daughters were in the helicopter with him?? Pleae tell me that is a misprint...His daughters were with him...I’m from the UK and have never watched a whole basketball game in my life, yet I still find myself saying “Kobe!” when, in basketball style, throwing something in the bin. RIP big man.To accomplish so much and then it’s just over so fast is truly a tragedy.[deleted]\\u202aIs it too soon to yell “Kobe!” when you crash your helicopter?\\u202cSeriously a class act. Basketball lost a great ambassador for the sport.Such a good dude, this world is fucked up. Today we lose a great member of all our teams. Rip kobe, you will be missed <3It doesn\\'t even feel real.Oh no,  no there’s going to be some parade of some sort in Los Angeles, can’t wait to turn up! R.I.P Kobe.Yelling “Kobe” after shooting a basketball shot is going to hit a little different nowCrazy shit. I haven\\'t watched or really cared about basketball for several years, but Kobe was always there, always on top. He seemed like a fun dude to hang out with. This is probably one of the most shocking deaths in recent years to me and probably everyone else. Mind blowing.Hope his family finds peace.Fuck everything. This is beyond devastating. A part of Los Angeles has died today.This is tragic, can\\'t believe it. I truly hope his children were not passengers in the helicopter. Any updates on that? :(This is truly heartbreaking.[removed]I\\'m your average European who knows little about basketball and has never even watched a full game, but even I was shocked when I saw this news pop up in my feed.RIPNow this is a story all about how.   My helicopter got flipped turned upside down.   And I\\'d like to take a minute, just sit right there.     In west Philadelphia born and raised     On the Lakers is where I spent most of my days.   Chillin\\' out maxin\\' relaxin\\' all cool.   And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school.   When a couple of guys who were up to no good.   Started making trouble in my neighborhood.   I got on one little flight and my mom got scared.     She said \\'You\\'re movin\\' with your auntie and uncle up in the  Air\\'.    I begged and pleaded with her day after day.     But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way.   She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.   I put my Walkman on and said, \\'I might as well kick it\\'.   First class, yo this is badKobe Bryants one of those universal Sportsman celebrities name that everyone knows about. Im from the UK and have never seen a game of basketball in my life and know bassically who he was.Theres going to be a lot or \\'where were you when Kobe died\\' talks in years to come.Such a terrible way to goAs a lifelong Lakers fan starting in the early 80s when my folks and I would cheer Showtime and spew our hatred of all opponents, I remember so many amazing moments watching this man play the game I love.All the hate that went his direction, but he never stopped giving his whole heart to basketball.I feel like I’ve lost a family member. It’s ridiculous. Stupid. Nonsensical.All sympathy to his family and loved ones. He cannot be replaced.Kobe for accuracy.Yeet is what the water is doing coming out out of my face.RIP to a legend. His legacy, his face, his numbers, and hopefully his family will always carry on.Holy shit.I thought this was an Onion article or a joke.What a tragedy, especially for his wife and children.FUCK. I thought it was just some fucked up fake news that they reported on, like with Lil Wayne? But then I started seeing it everywhere. First I was skeptical, because the game didn\\'t break for it, but now? Jesus. I\\'m so sad, I loved Kobe. Hell, my whole family loved this dude My parents for more deep reasons, but he was always a cool guy imo. Damn, I especially feel for his wife and young daughters. Imagine losing your dad in like the blink of an eye.Having been in US naval aviation I can firmly say that I do not trust helicopters.[deleted]Didn’t believe the title when I first saw and had to read it again for reality to sink inIs there a live thread?Rest In Peace oh legend! 😞dude helicopters are so dangerousonly 41 years oldhe accomplished so much and had so much more to doDamn. I don\\'t even really basketball. Been to one NBA game in my life. And even this caught me. Feels surreal.This is just absolutely terrible 😥[deleted]I don\\'t like how this year is progressingAbc reporting that Kobe n his 4 daughters were on board omg[deleted]*Wakes up from coma* Man I can\\'t wait to watch my favorite basketball player.....wow. I\\'m beyond shocked and I can\\'t express it in wordsMy thoughts are with his family and loved ones. RIP the legendThey’re reporting Rick Fox was also among the victimsCan anyone confirms/deny the daughters being present onboard?I\\'ve literally never watched basketball before and yet I know this guy\\'s name. A real legend. Feels weird when I saw the headline. Always sucks hearing of someone like this passing. When someone like this dies it feels like they were never gonna die. Like they\\'re a part of life because they\\'re so famous you hear about them whether or not you\\'re interested in what they doWhat the heck. I haven\\'t felt this confused and surreal since Michael Jackson died. This is so out of the blueAbsolutely insane to hear about. My heart breaks for his familySomewhere in this world, a Shaquille O\\'Neal is calling out to Kobe to pass the ball.  There is no ball to be passed, Shaq.  I\\'m sorry.An ultimate legend and my main idol and inspiration. So dedicated and persistent. Rip legendHe seemed like such a genuine dude and transcended basketball and simply became a part of culture. Whenever kids get a D on their test they just got back they crumple that shit, and throw it in the trash yelling his name.[deleted]This will be the sports equivalent of Princess Diana\\'s death.So sad Even worse sounds like his 4 daughters were on the flight:(If I\\'m ever in millionaire, there\\'s no way in hell I\\'m getting in a helicopter.Im a middle aged bloke from Ireland who has zero interest in basketball, (soccer and rugby are my sports) and even I knew who Kobe was, thats how much his fame transcended his sport because of how good he was. Horrific news.Out of all things, a helicopter crash. Goddamn.[deleted]Nah, this is very hard to believe that this man is no longer here 😩.Damn now there saying his 4 daughters were onboard as well wowEdit: This is according to ABC news said but also that they are trying to verify wtfI\\'m in absolute shock. I have no other words than that.My husband (Avid sports fan) couldn\\'t seem to process the words \"Kobe Bryant died\" when I just told him. His face drew a blank attempting to figure out who I was talking about. Guess that shows how surreal this news is.Always been told death is about remembering the good that happened in somebodies life. What’s your favorite Kobe memory?[removed]Did he have a pilot license? ABC is reporting his 4 kids were on board but wasnt one a newborn?  Did his wifes entire reason for living get wiped out or was she on too? This news is wild.I\\'m glad the rest of his family wasn\\'t on-board...I’m honestly shocked, RIP.This is just proves when your time is up your time is up, death comes for us all and it can happen at any time to anyone.[removed]How long until I can say \"Kobe\" as I brick a paper ball at my office trash can?this dude raped a girl in 2003 and had multiple affairs. nothing really lost with him gone.Holy shit.....id never imagine this guy would die, thought he would live forever. Sometimes you just never know what the day holds in store for you.Never take a helicopter if you can avoid it.I just can’t even think right now. LA will mourn todayThis world sucks, it took Kobe.Most helicopters crash when the pilot loses sight of the ground or horizon because they are only VFR (Visual Flight Rated). Average time to live once the pilot loses the horizon is 1 min 20 sec, based on historical data.The crazy thing is that the Sikorsky S-76, the helicopter in the crash, was IFR - Instrument Flight Rated, which means that the helicopter could actually fly in foggy weather, lose sight of the horizon, and be okay. The helicopter was a $13m machine, meaning it had all the best controls.Unbelievably tragic, he was one of the best basketball players of all time. RIP Kobe. Atleast he was able to achieve his highest peak of success in his lifetime. Many will never accomplish a fraction of what he did.2020 off to a quick start trying to beat out 2016 for being a terrible year.Not looking forward to a r/Fuck2020 like we had r/Fuck2016.My Spurs have had some of the most epic battles against this man. Rest easy Mamba 🐍Hoping this is not true.Way too soon man. I\\'m not a huge basketball fan but this one hurts a lot for some reason. I was standing on line at the supermarket when the radio said it and we all looked at each other like what the fuck?[deleted]Random and unfortunate newsStay away from heroin and helicopters kids (shout out to citizen cope and Carlos Santana)This freaking disheartening. What the fuck 2020.Just goes to show, money can\\'t buy everything. Hug your family.[Time Traveler Alert](https://twitter.com/dotnoso/status/268466325842694144?s=21)RIP. Nothing else to say, just an absolute legend that will be missed dearly.I hate this so much. This just feels so wrong.People keep saying the other passengers were his daughters. I’m only seeing people cite one report from ABC and it doesn’t add up. He’d have had to be the pilot, and also isn’t one of the daughters like 6 months old?Edit: sounds to me like people are repeating unconfirmed rumors.Edit 2: One daughter confirmed by Kobe’s reps. > 12:35 PM PT -- Kobe\\'s daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Now that is some seriously shit luck. Still, dude achieved more in 41 short years than other do in 90[deleted]This news fucked me up beyond another level I told my job I might need some bereavement days off from workAnother legend gone too soon.I’m shocked and heart brokenWow this year 2020 is really really cursed!!Damn... He Kobe\\'d himself...Any one read the reason why the chopper went down? Can’t find anything on itI don’t like this simulation anymore... :(Does Kobe have a home in Calabasas? I think he lives in Newport Coast right?[deleted]I’ve never been a basketball fan, but he always seemed like a great person to me. This hurts. RIP legend.This is a hell of a terrible start to 2020 and it hasn\\'t even passed January yet...Kobe died while travellingRIP from a lifelong spurs fan. You broke our hearts many times but was a privalge to see one of the greatest at his peak.RIP, loved watching him play.Absolutely fucking heartbreaking.He was my biggest inspirationI feel like this is the 4th or 5th time I’m reading about someone dying on a helicopter in the past 2 years. What’s up with those things?Holy shit. I can’t believe this. RIP Kobe.ABC is saying his 4 daughters were on board. Awful. Wife must be a wreck. Can’t even imagineEdit. Word is maybe just one daughter. Gigi. She was 13I’m gonna believe he faked his own death and chillin on a yacht right nowSo terrible. Incredibly saddened. RIP Kobe.This is the worst day I\\'ve had in a long, long time. Welcome to 2020 folks.What the fuck I’ve lived through a lot and this is one of the most shocking things I’ve ever heard.RIP to a husband, father, brother, son. Kobe Bryant 1978 - 2020Yeah ABC said his daughters were on boardI guess God needed an All-Star CaptainI can’t believe this is realDidn\\'t he rape a woman?Fuck. Any confirmation that his passengers where/ where not  his daughters?This might be the first celebrity death I’m sad about.[removed]Wow I\\'ve had the biggest \"Oh what the fuck\" and I don\\'t even follow basketball AT ALL.[deleted]I\\'m really really hoping this is a fake news. This is so hard to accept.[deleted]Holy fuck, my heart just sank.  This is a nightmare.[deleted][deleted]The world lost an adulterer and rapist, oh noesI’ve been hearing on Facebook that all 4 of his daughters were on the helicopter with him. Apparently they said something along those lines during the Pro Bowl...I hope to god that’s not true. 😢😢At least he left behind beautiful musichttps://youtu.be/cl_WkTiH6-QWerw his daughters on board??? Oh my godWhat the hell, dude? I’m not a basketball fan, but I have immense respect for Kobe Bryant. Rest easy, man.ABC just reported that his 4 daughters were the other passengers and that just hurt my soul to its core.Edit: Still no confirmation on this updateEdit 2: Confirmed report that it was only his 13 year old with him. Still tragic, nonetheless.Sending love to his wife and daughters. Girls need their daddies. Absolutely heartbroken for them. 😢💙&#x200B;hes with xxxtentacion nowOh my. I was *not* expecting this at all. I had to take a double take when I first saw it to make sure I wasn\\'t misreading it. Damn...This man brought a lot of the happy moments of my childhood as a Lakers fan. A lot of shit has gone wrong over the last 4 years but this one made me feelTake your shirt off, twist it \\'round yo\\' handSpin it like a helicopter!!!!I just hope his rape victim doesn’t have to hear people praising him for weeks now.Absolutely stunned by this. I don’t even know what to say. I thought it was a bad joke at first.My heart goes out to his family. RIP legend.yo fuck this... Kobe was one of my idols. I\\'m crying rn, fuck thisCheck this outhttps://twitter.com/realpetermoon/status/1221525038551056385?s=21While the rest of us react to this as sports fans remember the people who know Kobe Bryant as so much more. A father, a husband, so much more. Praying for his family at this tragic timeThis is very shocking, very much unexpected.  Rest in Peace.He is a legend and someone I’ve always known my life (from late 90s onwards)His death should shock meWhy don’t I feel anything ?:(Was never a basketball fan, but I respect his talent and his plays. RIPApparently his kids were the other 4 on board :(RIP to an absolute legend.Damn, mere hours after having his record surpassed. That’s hitting me in the feels considering his last tweet.We all pretending he didn’t rape somebody now?[deleted]While this is extremely sad news, let us not forget that other people lost their lives in the crash as well... all with families who loved them. RIP to all involved...I can’t tell you how many times I’ve crumpled up a piece of paper, thrown it in the garbage, and yelled “Kobe.”[deleted]Dude I never once cheered for the lakers or Kobe in my life.  I just straight don’t like the organization.  But damn, this news has me feeling sad as fuck for some reason.  The world lost a legend today.  RIP.I\\'ve never understood why helicopters don\\'t have an emergency chute in the propeller. When shit goes down in a helicopter, it literally goes down.This is really rough, the NBA seems to have just gotten it\\'s own version of Roberto Clemente, Yaroslavl Lokomotiv, Munich Air Disaster, Marshall University. A tragic history to join. So sad.There are reports that Rick Fox has also passed. Anyone got a reliable source on this? If so, are the two related?f in the chat to a legendHave they confirmed who was on board with him? Really hoping it wasn\\'t his four daughters...Holy shit. This is so sad.At first I thought its Kanye West and I was so happy.Does anyone know who the other 4 were? Im hearing Rick Fox // one of his daughters and just want to confirm :(The best NBA player to mehttps://twitter.com/ParkerSmith415/status/1221527452066992128?s=09He’s the only athlete that never needs a full introduction. You’ve got Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Derek Jeter, Wayne Gretzky, etc. and then you’ve got Kobe. Just, Kobe. Everyone regardless of their sport knew who he was. His life was cut short but he lived it to the absolute best. I hope he knew what an impact he had on an entire generation of kids who grew up watching him. This is another example of why you need to live your life to the fullest, you never know when it’s your time. Rest easy Kobe.Jaystation: (SCARY) SUMMONING KOBE BRYANT AT 3 AM **GONE WRONG**[deleted][deleted]Does he man his own helicopter or is it piloted by someone else?Did everyone just forget that he raped a girl? I guess most of you weren’t born when it happened but still.I heard the other passengers were his daughters, my god that would be terrible.Even those that are not basketball fans know who he was. One of the best. RIP.Why do people give awards for this type of news?Know very little about basket ball... but knew the name and that he was a legend, a hero to millions and one of the all time greats that transcended his sport... truly shocking news Rest in peace!That\\'s horrific. Early reports state that at least one of his daughters was on board as well. His poor, poor wife. My heart goes out to her.[removed]The last time I was so shaken by a celebrity death like this was Michael Jackson. Holy shit.RIP, Black Mamba :(This is the first celeb death that truly hit me hard. The dude was my idol when I was growing up.NEVER RIDE A HELICOPTER IN FOGGY CONDITIONS. This could have been prevented. Really sad.I\\'m actually going to stop saying \"Kobe!\" when throwing my used condoms in the garbage out of respect. If Kobe is reading this, Rest in Peace, legend. If he\\'s not which is most likely the case then you all should know I enjoyed watching him play basketball. And rest in peace to the other people in that helicopter. They were people too.It’s so surreal how quickly anyone’s life can end in an instant. Even though I don’t even follow basketball I’m shocked.Where the kids in there too ?Edit: Deleting this comment to make sure no false info is spread. RIP Kobe and the other passengers.OMG this is one of saddest days in the history of basketball.  RIPDamnn... I wasn\\'t readyI had just seen a game recap this morning and him congratulating LeBron! Holy crap!https://go.citizen.com/Ct4uc7Qvz3No way man, RIP to one of the greatest athletes of all time. Reports say his four daughters were with him. I’m speechlessWow. I don\\'t think I\\'ve been more caught off guard by a headline than this one. RIP.I was pretty shocked when I heard the news and I don\\'t follow basketball.  RIP.I thought this was fake... Sad!41 years and the man touched so many lives, inspired so many people, including young ballers in NBA to live their dream, and left a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come. Rest easy, king!!!I\\'m absolutely devastated. FUCK helicopters, seriously. Stevie Ray Vaughn, one of the best guitar players and blues musicians in history also died in a helicopter accident.I won\\'t touch a helicopter with a 10 foot pole after this shit. They\\'re fucking GOAT killers.ABC News reporting his 4 children may have been on board as well...This is crazy. So shocked man. I heard Rick Perry was one of the people too. I hope that isn\\'t true. Rip to a fucking legend.I refuse to believe it. No fucking way, no no no no no no.    I am shocked to my very core. That’s impossible. Please be fake news.this is so fucking sadit doesnt feel realWere his kids in the helicopter?I’ve seen multiple articles now say that his daughters were also on board the helicopter. Does anyone in know if this is true?Fuck. You just never know when.I don\\'t understand. This doesn\\'t seem real at all. Like... it\\'s Kobe Bryant.ABC says his daughters were the other passengersEdit: May not be true this was just a comment abc said wasn’t verifiable. Then tmz tweeted That Giana Marie might have been a passenger but they took that tweet down so I’m not sure.I wonder if there was any foul play involved(thought traveling in the air was legal in basketball)Actually really sad still[removed]Probably the most notable athlete death of our time.Incredibly sad how much he gave go basketball and how little he got to enjoy retirement.Cheers to one of my childhood idols.[deleted]Words cannot describe how much Kobe meant to me. Rest in peace, King.[removed]I don’t even like basket ball. It’s the one sport growing up I just never enjoyed playing or watching. But I always knew about Kobe. He was a legend. This is insane. RIPI\\'m not even a basketball fan and I fucking feel this. He had such a huge cultural impact, this is just hard to believe.God, I\\'ve followed Kobe\\'s career since he was a superstar at Lower Merion. They played in the same division as my alma mater, and as a senior he drew an incredible overflow crowd to our tiny gym to witness his greatness. Sure, he beat the Sixers in the 2001 Finals - he even said he wanted to rip our hearts out. That lead to a complicated love/hate relationship with his hometown of Philadelphia, but once he retired and was such a visible Eagles fan during their Super Bowl run, I think that made him one of us again. Also, this brings back memories of Roy Halladay\\'s death 2 years ago. I\\'m absolutely sick.I feel for his friends family and fans.  My heart goes out to all who are feeling this tragedy at their core. He will be remembered and celebrated for years to come.  Shoot a basket today and yell from you soul “KOBE!!!”I never been a basketball fan, but know his name.Sad day for sports...It doesn’t even feel real because most NBA legends from my childhood and before are still alive. I haven’t really experienced this before[deleted]Someone from ABC is reporting that his 4 daughters were killed as well, but another report is saying Rick Fox was onboard as well. Five people were killed, so one of these reports are wrong.this gotta be the shittiest year in the past 20 years. And we are still January ffs[removed]RIP Kobe and also the other 4 people on board. Horrible tradegyWHat the FUCK!?!? God damn. Rest In Peace...Yesterday, bosslogic (the most famous fanart maker on IG) posted a pic he made of Kobe and LeBron, and at the time I thought it looked ominous...Rip koby I just found this out today I thought it was a joke but I guess not[removed]This is unbelievable... doesn’t feel realVery sad news. And a reminder to never die in the same accident as a celebrity. RIP to Kobe and the “4 others”R.I.P dude one of the best in the NBA.It was Bryant and his four daughters in the crash. How awful for his wife.this can’t be happening yooo. this man was my entire childhood 😭. well may he fly high 🕊 and best wishes for his family.[removed][removed]The legend of the Black Mamba will live forever. Rest up Kobe, condolences to his family and friends across the world of sports, and to the fans and players he\\'s inspired through an incredible career. Fuck...there are reports that his 4 daughters were with him, fucking terribleI never trusted helicopters. If there is an engine failure you have no options legt to survive. In a plane you can still land without engine. HELICOPTERS ARE JUST NOT A SAFE MEAN OF TRANSPORTATIONI\\'m not a basketball fan but this guy transcended the sport. Really sucks for everyone involved. RIPRemember when you were youngJesus, reading that went right through me. He\\'s the dude that got me into basketball. RIP MambaI hope next NBA player that shoots a basket in a game yells “Kobe!”[removed]Why do people get into helicopters? I watched two crash in NYC over just the past couple years. One of them, multiple people died as it landed upside down in the east river.Mamba out, Legend, we will miss youThis shit is sad, my entire basketball team is mourning his death. I wish the best for his wife and kids. That sucks hard.[removed]Damn! I mean, I dont think I\\'ve ever watched a game of basketball or even fully understand the rules, but I recognise Kobe as one of the legends of the NBA world and this news has affected me more than I thought it would have :( Its insane how someone can have such an effect on people even if they dont necessarily follow what made them so famousRIP Kobe and others involved :(Thoughts to all of those directly affected by thisIt hasnt sunk in yet. Cant believe it.  It\\'s fucking insaneFlying is safer than driving, right.Bet Kobe still be alive if he took a limo tho, justsayinApparently his daughters were also on board. Anyone else see that?[removed]When people invoke you name when attempting an amazing shot, you know you\\'re a sports legend. Rest in Peace, Kobe.RIP Kobe my brother always looked up to you.SOMEONE TELL ME ITS A FUCKING JOKE OR PRANK.... I still can’t believe it....jesus fuck 2020 needs to calm the fuck downThis is surreal. It feels like a bad dream.Praying his daughters weren\\'t also on board like some news sites are reporting!!Just another reason to stay the fuck away from helicopters.[ABC is reporting his 4 daughters were on board as well.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.local10.com/news/local/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-dies-in-california-helicopter-crash/%3foutputType=amp)The irony of this happening today is just insane.I\\'m going to have to have all my students crumple up a piece of paper and throw it in the trash can tomorrow while shouting \"Kobe\" in his honor....What the hell is 2020? This year sucks.[deleted]I was talking about him thia friday with a co worker. Holy shit man...this year.[This](https://youtu.be/VIgHVlb151c) is always the first thing I think of when I hear Kobe.i’m crushed. he was and always will be an inspiration. RIP MambaThis doesn’t feel real. Kobe seemed like one of those mythical, immortal kind of guys.That\\'s unreal, and horribly sad. The man probably had 50+ years left in the tank :([removed][deleted][removed]Just doesn’t feel realRIP my man. He lived 41 years fuller than most people\\'s entire lives ever will.Matt Gutman on ABC NEWS said “the fact that 4 of his children are believed to be on that helicopter with him, all daughters - one of them a newborn, is simply devastatingRest in peace to Kobe and his daughter 💔🙏[removed]I don\\'t want to believe this oneOh dear.&#x200B;RIP.I wonder what caused the crash?We’re any of his daughters on the helicopter?I usually don\\'t get worked up over celebrity deaths but I mean shit. That\\'s Kobe Bryant.Weird af: https://i.imgur.com/nqa6yZq.png[deleted][removed]Looks like he yeeted himself into the ground. Kobe!I dont know whether to upvote this because of its significance or downvote it because I wish to God it wasnt true.making jump shots or throwing stuff in the trash while yelling \"kobe!\" won\\'t feel the same manVery sad. RIP Say hello to Mac Miller for us. 😔[deleted]I have never really enjoyed Basketball, but I have always loved Kobe... He has become such a household name from just being a legend at what he does, to being the name you shout when you’re trying to land that perfect paper ball shot into the trash can. I’m very oddly affected by his passing and wish his family the best in this trying time. :,([deleted]This is just.. wow man.Ah, pulling a good ol\\' John Denver. Godspeed sweet prince.CNN just confirmed it. This is tragic beyond comprehension.Fuck I guess I can’t tell KOBE when I throw something away :( RIPAh fuck. This is pretty horrible. One of the only celebrities I actually care about. Sad.Condolences to his family.RIP to the 5 lives lost. It\\'s gonna be tough telling my dad about this. He\\'s a big fan.I know absolutely nothing about Basketball but this still feels unreal. My heart goes out to his family. Rest In Peace Mr. Bryant and all the other victimsI thought I heard wrong just now when I passed the nurses station and they were talking about this. How very sad this is. He was truly a legend. My heart goes out to his friends and family.Really don\\'t want this to be trueDaily reminder that this dude was an adulterer and a rapist. Being able to throw a ball into a hole better than other people doesn\\'t excuse that shit.Bummer. I remember their multi year run while he and Shaq worked through it and won it all with some great teams..R.i.p. man.RIP KobeAbsolutely sadWtf this just feels so crazyThis one hits hard, as someone growing up an athlete in high school in the late 2000s. He was the one you looked towards to see what true determination and singular focus could achieve.I hope his family he left behind are okI just missed the shot when I shouted Kobe, then I got the notification it happened...I’m so sorry guys, it’s all my faultKobe is the reason I played basketball and the reason it became my favorite sport.  I pretty much stopped watching basketball after he retired.  RIP.Jesus christ. I always sports-hated Kobe but this is fucking shatteringthis one really hurts.I can\\'t believe it. Truly one of the greats. The game of basketball will never be the same. R.I.P. Kobe Bryant[deleted][deleted]WhatNo fucking wayI refuse to believe thisCan\\'t really say his death affects me in any way.   Never cared about basketball, he was an alleged rapist.   doesn\\'t seem like the world lost muchMy favorite player of all time and the reason I started watching basketball 20 years ago....can\\'t believe this. Fuck this one hurts :(As a person who rarely follows sports I totally still recognized the importance Kobe had to our society as a whole. This is a tragic loss and I can\\'t even begin to fathom what his wife and daughters are going through.I don’t watch basketball but damn, a big shock when I heard that he died.His biography is one of the only books I actually sat down to read. This guy was nothing but talent and dedication since grade school. RIPDude life is so fucking fleeting. Live and love every moment, even the bad ones. Can’t believe Kobe is gone.[This looks to be the flight. ](https://fr24.com/data/flights/n72ex#23a8271e) Was going 170 mph when it stopped reporting flight data.Now every time we “Kobe” something into a garbage bin or a hoop, we shall always remember his legacy. RIP Kobe, sad to see you go.Heard it on KNX 1070 right when it broke I don’t even follow the NBA and it fucking hit me hard. Grew up  in SoCal my whole life m, and we was just one of those greats that we all knew and admired.That\\'s incredibly sad given that last tweet.  Condolences for the family.We are three weeks into 2020 and I already want 2019 back.One less rapist in the world.Man, this is just terrible news. May he and the others that died rest in peace. This first month of 2020 has been a god damn shitshow.First the possibility of WWIII, then the Coronavirus, and now no more Kobe. The said the 20s would roar. Didn\\'t know it tear us up like a lion, too.I mean, it\\'s still fucking January, for the love of Christ!Rest in piece Kobe. May you be walking on the plains along with us.ESPN just cut from the pro bowl to an ABC breaking news and guy said all his kids were on board also?Its nice getting info out so soon to people but so many unknowns seems crazy to have people reporting it so quickly.As a Sacramento native I grew up hating Kobe cause of the heart break he caused but this is just sad. What a shit way to go.Oh come on man... Not Kobe. This is terrible news. Rest in peace kingRIP KOBE. Gone too soon. You’ll always be better than LeBron to me.Way too soon. Seriously, this is a complete shock to everyone and I wish nothing but support for his family. Rest In Peace mambaMan.. I’m just lost for words.Fuckin unfortunatly random ass death; that one. Un&#x200B;Man, I will never fly in a helecopter unless it\\'s to the hospital.&#x200B;Shit freaks me out; real low; real fast, and if the engine shuts off you fall and explode.&#x200B;Atleast planes can still stear and glide a bit when they lose ppower.Everyone just forgets he raped a women. Huh.2020 reallys is the final boss 😭 RIP KobeThis timeline sucks ass.Defo a terrible start to 2020 so farRIP Mamba. One of the purest scorers to play the game. Very sad for the family.I don’t give a shit about sports but I even I know this man is a legend. Super sad.ABC said his kids may have been the other occupants but nobody else is confirming that yet - God I hope they’re wrong.Someone please tell me what I just think I heard isn\\'t true.. of the 4 others killed in the crash, multiple were his daughters..I fear the helicopter and small plane.I know nothing about basketball but I’m still in shockReally sad to hear this. RIP and condolences to his family.Side note: Who are these freaks who sit waiting for someone to die so they can change the ‘is’ to ‘was’ on Wikipedia?I fully understand that I will be downvoted to hell, and that emotions run high, but let\\'s also not forget that he [**very** probably raped a girl](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession)Now I’ll get upset whenever I Kobe something RIPI literally thought it was fake I’m crushed and I’m in disbelief he’s deadUnreal everyone at my gym stopped dead in their tracks and is mesmerized by the headlines.Fucking sucks. I\\'m a grown ass man and I feel like cryingOMG this is so incredibly sad, his poor wife2020 just fucking blows.Incredible player - I remember when he was drafted out of high school - at a time when that was really rare.  He came in with tons of hype - and exceeded it all on the court.  I’m not a Laker fan, but damn that’s just a shame.He was the Michael Jordan of my era.Jordan was a little bit before my time, but I remember as a kid hearing a lot about Kobe when he just started.F.I\\'m really upset about this. Rest in peace, legend.RIP to the 3 other nameless people.The 4 that died with him were his daughters?? ReportedlyEDIT: It was one daughter. Gianna Marie. Reportedlyhttps://twitter.com/GlobalNews77/status/1221535090116833286?s=19I open reddit for the first time today and this is the news I’m greeted with? I don’t even know what to say. Going back under my covers*I went to high school with Kobe. He was a senior when I was a freshman. Seniors are already larger than life to freshman but can you imagine having Kobe as your idol, 360 dunking IN GAME, taking Brandy to the prom etc. When I was a senior he would always hook the team up with Adidas gear and come visit Coach Downer once in a while & give us a pep talk. He made me believe that anything is possible. This news makes me sick to my stomach but I promise if Kobe could speak he would say don\\'t be sad because he achieved all his dreams and then some. He would probably want us to focus on our own aspirations and pray for the families of the other four who died. He was as fierce a competitor you could find, but off the court was a gentleman, a beautiful dichotomy. RIP  I still cant believe it.Every time I think about the 90’s I think about this guyEdit: I know you’re hogging the ball in heaven. R.I.PAbsolutely devastating. I can’t believe it.Rest in Peace Black Mamba.You will always be a role model even in the future with your Mentality.I will never take a helicopter anywhere.This is so tragic and unexpected. RIP Kobe, you’ll be sorely missed.What a legend. Thinking of your friends and family mambaI hope the pilot had a sense of humor and yelled “Kobe!” just before impactImagine being his wife right now. Entire family just...gone.Damn. RIP. I remember seeing him at a Baskin Robins with his kid in Newport Beach a  couple years ago. I’m a die hard Clippers fan and hate the Lakers, but I had to say to him before I left, “You’re the man, Kobe.”  Just tell’n the truth.My favourite Kobe moment will always be in Rush Hour 2 when Chris Rock is running up the stairs in Hong Kong and some random old Asian dude yells \"GET OUT OF MY WAY, KOBE\".Kobe Bryant was a rapistThis is fucked up. RIPOne of the best to ever play the game. Newborn daughter, just tragic. RIP Mamba :(Sounds like his daughters/family may have been on board too...that news just hits so damn hard.Edit: not confirmed, hoping it never is.His kids too.. Wtf manI have no words right now. This cannot be.This is so sad I pray for their family.It doesn’t matter what sport you followed. if you were a fan of sports, you knew and respected Kobe. RIPSome news sites are saying his 4 daughters with him. Any validity to this?Holy shit. Absolutely the last thing I expected to see getting online today. I am not a fan of sports by any means but I still can\\'t imagine how big of a deal this is.This is wild. Anybody can go, at anytime. Have to make your life count while you have it.There might always be an argument about who is the GOAT  but there is very little argument that he was one of the greatest ever. RIPOk so who threw the molotov at Kobe\\'s attack helicopter.Wait... some outlets saying his 4 daughters were on board?!?! No.....Watched him play in person against the Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals in Denver. Everybody hated (HATED) him, but you can’t deny the impact he had on sports. I just...what the fuck.Wow Rick fox on board too omgWow this is sad. Now everytime someone says \\'Kobe\\' for a shot, it\\'s gonna get me in the feels.I can\\'t fucking believe it. Legend died too youngThis is the first celebrity death I actually said \"holy shit\" to,> I don\\'t want to be the next Michael Jordan, I only want to be Kobe Bryant.RIP KobeI dont even watch or like basketball but a player like Kobe transcends the sport itself.  Never take a moment for granted!  RIP to Kobe and the others lost in the crash.[deleted]Damn, can we get an f chain going to show respect for the legendHe’s with all the greats in sports history now Forever one of the greatestHoly fuck. Did not expect this. Don’t even watch sports but still, RIP man.I hope it wasn\\'t a bird strike. I hate it when he gets fowled out.RIP to the one of the heavy hitting GOATs. He will be missed.Absolutely shocking. An icon from my childhood. We all say his name before chucking something in a trashcan. He was a true legend.Just last night he sent out a tweet congratulating lebron, i can’t believe it. I’m not a big basketball ball fan but even I knew who Kobe was. Rest In PeaceHug your family and friends. Life is a gift and tomorrow is not promised today.I’m 24 years old. Struggling to think of a bigger celebrity death in my lifetime than this, especially regarding how unexpected and out of the blue this was. RIPAs a GSW fan, I grew up watching Kobe thrash us every time we played. He was a stone cold KILLER on the hoops floor. His ability to close out a game was unparalleled. His 61 point game on his last night out gave me chills.RIP to a legendDude this is insane, I\\'m so in shockreason i feel in love with basketball. KOBE FOR THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERIP young GodJust found out about it via a push notification from ESPN, that sends you to an article about LeBron passing his scoring record last night.  They just tacked on a couple sentences at the beginning about his death.  WtfWhen your favorite singer Chester is gone at the age of 41, and less than three years later your favorite basketball player Kobe is now gone at the age of 41I still can’t believe this happened. RIP KobeI\\'m not even a major basketball fan and this still hits hard... RIPRIP Kobe. I\\'ll be keeping an eye out for the NTSB report to see what the cause was. 50/50 it\\'s pilot error.I am fucking devastated. RIP, Kobe.Someone on ABC just mentioned his family may have been on board. Can someone please tell me that’s not true?ABC said his kids were on the helicopter too.Wtf... I open my phone and I just stop to realize what I just read. I’m still in shock. I can’t imagine how his family must feel, how the world feels, and how LeBron feels.The dude just passed Kobe on the scoring list recently.... Jesus Christ... I’m in shock.[deleted]Damn, you never know when it’s your time. RIP Kobe. Condolences to the Family.Edit: Just heard his 13 year old daughter was also in the helicopter :(Let\\'s just skip 2020 and move on to 2021.RIP to an amazing legendary player. Feels so surrealProbably the first time I\\'m genuinely sad over the death of a celebrity. Such an icon. Tragic woudnt begin to describe this loss. R.i.p. Kobe...I had to read this from multiple sources. Still hard to believe. RIPThis is Lebrons Illuminati Sacrifice.I wish his family the best. I hope they can support each other and heal together. RIP to a father, husband and one the greatest to play basketball.heard his daughters were with him on the helicopter, is taht true?Goddamn he was only 41, had so much more to give and leaves a family behind with a daughter that isn\\'t even 1, horribly unfortunate.Can I get a Kobe in the chatWow, was not expecting this; not that you ever do.I looked at which sub it was coming from, expecting it might be on r/jokes or similar.Terrible day for rain.Seeing reports his daughters were on board? Any news?[deleted]So shocking and sad.  41 years old,damnWe grew up shooting trash into the trash can yelling \"Kobe\" and now the man behind the inspiration of such a thing has tragically passed. Doesn\\'t seem real. Wow. RIP Kobe Bryant...I’m at a loss for words. SO shocked. He leaves behind a wife and daughters, absolutely awful. Rest In Peace, Mamba. 🙏🐍Kobe was more than a basketball player. An incredible role model, family man, and the creator of the mamba mentality. Such a hard working man who deserved to live out the rest of his life with happiness and peace. He is truly inspirational, one of the only people I can name that surpassed expectations in all ways. RIP Kobe, you will never be forgotten. I’ll work hard for you.Reports coming out that his kids were with him now. Nothing confirmed though.2020 has been one of the worst years ever and it\\'s only JanuaryI seriously thought and hoped this was a troll post that was upvoted for the meme.Damn.Are the other 4 passengers his daughters?Man this is fucking lame...Did his daughters die as well? I just saw a clip on tv claiming his daughters all diedEdit: [here’s the clip ](https://imgur.com/gallery/iuzC4iP)This is not how it was suppose to end. I wanted to see him grow old. Fuck....RIP my Legend, you will never die. The sadness is unreal.January 2020 is going out of handHis wife was not on the helicopter and is OK.  Silver lining, considering they have 4 kids.Never been upset over a celebrity death before. This one hits different. I’m sad as fuck. Rest In Peace legendWtf. I just woke up. Thats crazy[deleted]This has been the craziest month, I can\\'t imagine what the rest of 2020 will be like. R.I.P KobeI’m a very casual basketball fan but I was in shock when i read the headline and SHES a few years. God damn what the fuck.Damn man. I’m not even a sports fan but even I’m kind of in shock. The guy was a legend. Tragic death for everyone involved.An absolute legend... He will not be forgotten.I’m speechless. So heartbreaking. RIP Kobe 😭crazy. this reminds me when michael jackson died.Rest in peace Kobe. Never watched basketball but I respect your legend.2020 isn\\'t even a month in and it\\'s proving to be the most thoroughly cruel and unkind year in decades.If his kids were with him, that\\'s even more obscene. Retire rich and popular and a decent fellow. Take your kids on a helicopter ride, end up holding your infant daughter as you all die screaming in fire as your helicopter hits the ground.Sad news. He was my all time favorite. The reason I got hooked on basketball. RIPSo sad, life is too short, I remember watching Kobe growing up as a Celtics fan and he was a soo clutch in the end of games. Not many people like him come around often, sad to see he left us too soon.You will always be a legend who changed the game. Best wishes to your family. May you forever ball up in heaven with the greats. RIP Black MambaBig F in the chat boys. His family and the families of the others involved are in my thoughts. As I’m sure they are in everyone else’s.Helicopters are death traps.ABC News is reporting that his daughters were on boardSo devastating, right after such an amazing night of celebrations..... Hug your loved ones folks, a life can be taken in a moment. Even one so great as The Black Momba himself. RIPNews just broke into the best game and the anchor said Kobe was in the copter WITH HIS DAUGHTERS. Can anyone confirm this?RIP Kobe. I hated you in your prime because I loved how good you were!Welp, looks like I\\'ll be spending the rest of my Sunday afternoon trying to find a report that this is just a hoax.Damn this really come out of left field...This is just sad. We’ll all miss you Kobe, R.I.P.JESUS CHRIST the ads on this webpage are fucking disgustingThis .....is unreal. I can\\'t even fathom how big of a tragedy this is right nowI will never stop yelling “Kobe” when I throw trash away.UNC alum, but Kobe was my Jordan. Incredibly sad, RIP 5x Champ.I’m English, and when it comes to basketball, I don’t know my arse from a hole in the ground.But Kobe Bryant crossed over.This is a shock to me, as it will be to thousands, millions even, around the world who may not have known much about basketball, but knew the name of Kobe Bryant.I guess that the other way round, it would be like hearing that David Beckham just died (even though Becks did actually play in the States for a bit).Chin up, american friends.With love, your british cousins.Lebron surpasses Kobe on points for 3rd place all-time, Kobe congratulated Lebron in a tweet last night. It’s a stark reminder how fragile all our lives are, and how quickly it can all end so suddenly and without warning. I hope Kobe said goodbye to his family before he left.No way, breaks my heartJust casually browsing Reddit and I see this. What the fuuuck. Was just watching him on ESPN last nightDespite not being very \"in\" to basketball, I\\'ve always maintained a casual interest of the sport. Him and Shaq made the game very interesting for the years I was old enough to have more of an interest and understanding.Hugely influential,  tremendous player,. This fucking bums me out and makes me fucking sad. rest in pieceAbsolute fucking tragedy. Concrete icon. The man is truly a legend in the most literall form.Falling IconsViral Contagion Constant WarGlobal Warming Cheeto fingerprints all over the white houseWhats next?Wtf. This is like hearing about Aaliyah on the way back from a wedding on the radio. Soo random and before their time. This really sucks. He had soo much time left to enjoy retirement, and suddenly it\\'s gone.This January has been the shittiest year.I can’t believe this shit. He’s my favorite basketball player. This sucks so bad.Fucking awful.  Must have been terrifying. 😭Abc news is reporting the kids were on board.  Hope notMy first instinct was to think this was a joke headline. Wtf this is crazy.As someone who doesn\\'t watch NBA often, I\\'m saddened. RIP.Just stunning news. Live every day to the fullest because you just never know what will happen.Not even a huge basketball fan, but this makes me sick to my stomach.  RIP.this news hurts me so bad! i can’t believe his gone too soon 💔So fucking sad man.  Feel like shit.  Rest in power, god damn tragedy.R.I.P to the GOAT of my childhood 😞I’m so fucking gutted. RIP one of the GOATS. RIP BLACK MAMBA.News article left out the ass rape in Colorado.2020 is fucking ass!! Prayers to his wife and daughter.A moment of respect for him. He was a good guy definetly. Even though Im not an NBA fan, I know him well and admired in many aspects. REST IN PEACE LEGEND!Now ESPN saying his 4 daughters were all on the plane with him?!?! Sincerely hoping that was a mistake?Edit: https://twitter.com/misterlavine/status/1221526134703063041?s=21I haven’t heard this elsewhere so still hoping it was a mistakeEdit # 2: Now reading Rick Fox was among the deceased. If 5 are dead then that would mean the report cannot be true. But also reading that it might have been 6 total.Edit # 3: Rick Fox not on board https://twitter.com/courtneyfallon_/status/1221531721688068096?s=21Edit # 4: FUCK One of his daughters was on board https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/i knew to say \"kobe\" when throwing shit in the trash can before i even knew who kobe bryant was. devastating.What a national tragedy.I\\'m definately getting my bros and hooping tonightThis is up in out of left field news with Chester Pennington\\'s death. Wtf man[removed]Rip kobe. I don\\'t want to believe this is real. He has been my idol since middle school.I fucking hate this timeline[removed]We will never hear Kobe’s Hall of Fame speech ☹️I\\'m not even a sports fan, and this shocks me. I\\'m getting Paul Walker vibes over this story. Fucking surreal. :(omg RIP. his poor familyAbsolutely tragic news.  I can\\'t believe it. It doesn\\'t feel real hearing the news even. Thank you for the memories that you gave to the sport of basketball. RIP.[deleted]I was not always a fan of his, but he was undoubtedly one of the greatest to ever play the game. Rest In Peace Kobe 😔Damn, I don\\'t even watch sports ball and this still made me sad. Will continue to \"Kobe\" things into the trash in his honorAs a person who never watches basketball but knows Kobe as a famous basketball player, seeing his passing shocked me because I think of what basketball fans are going through after loosing a legend like him.My deepest condolences to his family and to all the basketball fans out there.Oh man no! I’m not a huge basketball fan but my one game was knicks vs lakers and I got to see Kobe play. Something I’ll cherish forever now. RIP to a great one. Made the game exciting.I feel so bad for everyone - the lost lives, the broken families.I won\\'t lie - I\\'m REALLY shook right now, because it turns out Kobe and my boyfriend have the exact same birthday.  Like I didn\\'t worry enough about car crashes already...tell your loved ones you love them y\\'all. RIP to the lost.This decade fucking sucks so far brosNot one for sports, but condolences to his family and the families of the other on board.My literal reaction was \"WHOA WHOA WHOA! WHAT?!\" when the wife said it.  I had to come here to see if it was confirmed true and why.I tried to look up the news and trending page on Twitter and other news sources, everything is down because every news places are trying to keep up with the latest information on the crash. My heart goes out to his family and everyone else who lost their loved ones from the crash. RIP Legend.I am sure there will be a candlelight vigil from all that pussy he slayed up in Aspen.No way dude. I refuse to believe.I\\'m not American. I\\'ve never watched basketball in my life.But I still say \"Kobe\" when throwing something in the trash because I\\'ve learned it from those that do. This man\\'s name is iconic around the world. RIP.Wtf, this is hitting hard. Dude seemed invincible.I\\'m at work, and I just found out. This shit is making me too emotional.Wow ABC news just said it is believed all four of his daughters were on the helicopter with him. What a tragedy!Some memories of Kobe [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fjhIWJSxfw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fjhIWJSxfw)Entire generation grew up shouting his name with every shot and I will for one will still shout his name to carry him with me always.ABC just reported his 4 daughters may have been with him.  I sure am hoping that’s false.He spanned so many different cultures, as someone who isn\\'t really a big basketball fan I can recognise an absolute icon of sport and he damn sure is. I do this anyway, but from now on when I throw something I will always shout KOBE, RIP to a legendI love you man. You\\'re an inspiration. Rest in peace. Love you so much bro.Heartbreaking. Absolutely heartbreaking. RIP Kobe. :(I heard the other 4 were his daughters. Is this true? There’s only one daughter and his wife? Fucking terrible.Rip that boy Kobe, he seen Lebron pass him on the all time scoring list, and he couldn’t handle it. Wild.There’s speculation that the other 4 were his kids...god I hope not, but damn what a black day.Fuck. Had to read that headline a couple of times.NO.  Just no.  NOOOOOWe did something to piss God off, and he was like \"yeah, fine, I won\\'t flood the earth again, but I\\'ll make you fuckers *wish I would.*Rest in Peace. Kobe was a sports legend and we\\'ll never forget him. #24 inspired everyone that\\'s ever touched a basketball.I know I’m late on this post and comment but Kobe for 20 years was an icon for the NBA and a global icon to millions and millions of people. One of the best players that’s ever done it. I agree it’s super shitty that the others don’t get mentioned, with that being said he was a global icon for 20 years so I completely understand why it’s always him mentioned most the time by himself. Not saying I agree with it but I do understand it.True. People were mourning the Kobe that exists in our minds.Covid bryanFor me too.Horny ass uber driverHorny ass uber deiverYes Kobe pressured him, thus being the culprit of why everyone lost their lives that day. How the fuck you ever gonna know!?amazing that your grandpa affected as many lives as kobe bryant, despite none of us knowing him0 fucksEven though he knew how to fly using instruments, he wasn’t legally allowed because the charter company didn’t have the certificationWho was this for?Been looking for this for sometimeThanks. You know if  Kobe was sitting in co-pilots chair?Can you share video link pleaseIs it possible he was disoriented and didn\\'t know which direction he was going exactly?Been wondering this toonot funny or edgyThere hasn’t been any report that they weren’t intact.. they just officially identified him by his fingerprints.Where was that reported? The part about not intact bodiespeople get sadder about people they know/know of die than in other cases - and thank fuck for that because people you don\\'t know die in droves every single day for reasons that should evoke empathy. google starvation deaths per day - 25.000.Yeah, you\\'re a little bit wrong there. Nobody is ignoring the other victims. But Kobe wasn\\'t just a celebrity or an athlete.  He\\'s in the same category as Michael Jordan if that helps.  Heck, Babe Ruth if you need to go outside of Basketball.  I wish I could explain it better but I\\'m at loss.  He was an inspiration for millionsIt is so fucking sad that 9 people died, but also, Kobe is the one people feel a personal connection to. He’s been a constant figure in the cultural consciousness for over two decades, while I had never heard of the other passengers, with the exception of his daughter. I haven’t watched a basketball game for about 10 years, but I have some great memories of watching him play with my family. My experience is shared by millions of people around the world.You also have to consider that for a lot of the current basketball players he was the poster on their wall, the guy they idolized, the athlete who inspired them to pick up a basketball. It makes sense that they would openly mourn their hero and friend. Even athletes from other sports admired Kobe for his work ethic, talent, and drive. Changing the NBA logo seems excessive, but he is a giant figure within the NBA, inspired and/or mentored dozens of the current active players, and broke countless records. Why wouldn’t people want the NBA to honor him?9/11 was painful and I still think about it to this day.Kobe feels like family to everyone. I don\\'t know the people on that flight that got shot down (not that their deaths are any less signifigant) however I know Kobe, not becuase I ever met him in real life; through his baskatball career, his speaches, his interviews you really know his personality, mannerisms and what he stood for even if you never met him.  Thats what makes things like this hard. Similiar to Paul Walkers sudden death, in a time with media readily available and starts in the spotlight you really feel like you know these people and they are such good role models. They are essentially your Hero\\'s and it is HARD to see your Hero\\'s die. Other celebrity/famous peoples deaths that really bothered me are **Prodigy** (the rapper), Prince, Selena and Aliyah... there are many videos, songs, interviews, etc and you really feel like you know these people even though you never met them. I feel like they should have had more time on the earth.Good comment, could be in part due to shared grief, so many around us have been affected, this might amplify our own feelings (and theirs)They crashed into a mountain at an estimated 175 mph. It’s gonna be burnt fragments or pieces that are a distance from the crash site die to the impact.[Also there\\'s a huge chance the entire thing was false accusations](https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape)[Also there\\'s a huge chance the entire thing was false accusations](https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape)heres a factiod to make you puke - 25k people die of starvation every day.I wonder how the info was passed from the rescuers to the news? Or did someone just have 24/7 surveillance on him ?Video is private.. what was it?Where’d you see it was hisBody?I am curious what happens to a body in a crash like this. What actually kills the person, blunt force trauma to the head?They have recovered only 3 so far, including KobeNothing\\'s going to save you going from 180+ MPH to 0 in a matter of millisecond. That isn\\'t survivable no matter what safety feature are included. The only way to survive is to not slam into a mountain side going that speed.[deleted]So you’re assuming a 13 year girl has done wrong in her life? And since Kobe did wrong they deserved to die ? She is 13 jesus[deleted]False. Also a Baseball coach and a basketball coach plus their daughters~~ something like thatDeath is tragic regardless. How old are you? Seems like something a 12 year old would say.The pilot in this case would still be able to see the instruments and controls though... not totally blind like your video.I\\'m not even a basketball fan and it\\'s upsetting to me.  Then to find out his little girl died too that just went from bad to much worse, and apparently she was a rising star in her own right.  Then the other families and the pilot.  It\\'s just a horrible thing to happen.Uhh, you’re thinking of a different player lmaohttps://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/\"6:11 AM PT -- 1/27 -- All 9 people on the helicopter have been identified ...Kobe Bryant (41), Gianna Bryant (13), John Altobelli (56), Keri Altobelli, Alyssa Altobelli, Sarah Chester, Payton Chester (13), Christina Mauser and the pilot, Ara Zobayan.\"There was already data from the helicopter posted yesterday. It\\'s public info I think. Earlier yesterday someone posted links to a YouTube video that showed the route, and I\\'m sure there\\'s audio somewhere too.His tweets:There’s no words to express the pain Im going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother @kobebryant I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOWKobe was so much more than an athlete, he was a family man. That was what we had most in common. I would hug his children like they were my own and he would embrace my kids like they were his. His baby girl Gigi was born on the same day as my youngest daughter Me’Arah.He\\'s probably been flying like this for years without a problem.Not exactly true if it makes you feel better. Helicopters can autorotate where the air moving through the rotors causes them to spin. Autorotation is the go to technique for emergency landing.Abrupt and unexpected. Paul Walker and Junior Seau come to mind for me. Not sure why. The death of MJ, Prince, and Whitney hit a little different. Maybe it’s because they OD’d, whereas the other had a ore violent death.Was thinking about this and Prince immediately came to mind. But then I realized we almost expect our musical heroes to die by drug overdose, its so common. Athletes are usually our models for health so its way more shocking when they die suddenly from a fluke like a helicopter crashHe is pretty unknown outside of the US, aside from Basketball fans ofc. I had to look him up.Yeah, this is comparable to Lennon which I remember clearly. Race fans had Dale Sr. but that wasn’t such a shock to the whole world. Music world Elvis in the 70s and had SRV in the 80s which still gets me. This is literally a shock to the whole world. And if it comes down to pilot error flying in bad weather...damn. It was so foggy that police even had their helicopters grounded at the time of the crash.Robin Williams? Heath ledger?I\\'m not pilot but apparently the reason to fly low is because it was foggy. A helicopter can\\'t go as high as a plane.I think the most common sensed to do was \"alright, we are just gonna drive there\"I think that and also people are horribly insensitive and can\\'t fathom why a celebrity death is seen as \"more important\" than the other victims. Horrible situation all around but apparently you\\'re a POS for not acknowledging every single tragedy happening around the world.Same age, agree totally. He might not of been Mike, but closest I’ve seenWhat’s funny to me is when you die, your post would garner negative upvotes because you’re completely irrelevant lmao[deleted]100 people is a statistic.There was only 1 Kobe Bryant and he was extremely well known.I hope that sheds light on the matter.upvotes dont really matter, dont get in a tizzy about itWhy do you care?It’s because of the cultural impact this one guy had. It’s a shock, but also a reminder that anybody can go at any time.I won’t watch that. Wish it could somehow just be deleted forever.[deleted]Really man?The Sikorsky’s have a phenomenal safety record.The thing is, to many people he was so much more than a guy. He was a role model. a goal, a friend they never met, and he represented so many peoples aspirations.Not really..He died tooIt’s reported he was at mass the morning of the crashYou’re the only one saying no one cares. A lot of people care.Exactly. We are not here to stay. This is not our home.Not a basketball fan nor have I watched any basketball games on TV. But I grew up hearing this guy\\'s name from the mouths of everyone around me. Hearing this is too sudden. I still can\\'t believe it actually. I hope his family is doing alright. God knows what\\'s on their heads after hearing this. Rest in peace Kobe and Gianna.[deleted]You\\'re even worst.If only there was a way to find out who he was and what he didDon\\'t cut yourself on that edge11:00am, at the bar eating lunch watching figure skating on the tv when the bartender changed the channel on the other tv to some TMZ bs then cut the jukebox, we all sat in silence watching the TV in disbelief. And that’s how his family found out, also, through Social Media. How disrespectful of TMZ.[deleted]Great idea . ✔️Oh did I upset some religious people? That\\'s too bad.Kove is a fantastic bball player and I am very sad he\\'s gone but he wasn\\'t a saint.Kobe faced karma. Believe that. If you dont see it you are blind to the facts.Here, have some internet karma.I have been quietly thinking the same actually. And I’ve been quiet about it because verbalizing it as you have just makes you the asshole.Their names are all over the news now, but okay.I’m sorry you can never look at a chicken wing again. RIP to all 9 persons, may their next life be full of joy.I want to assume that it didn\\'t look like that during take off. If that was me, I would\\'ve been \"nope, Uber it is\"If that’s what it looked like I just don’t understand why the pilot would want to fly especially with 8 other people on board three of them children.Lol.... did you try and click the news article?And people worship someone with few other skills who only does something so stupid as to bounce a ball for a living. Just throw a ball and the whole world will worship you like a god, give you whatever you want, and let you get by with any crime.And get hit by a drunk driver.The other 7 wouldn\\'t get headline news coverage at all if there\\'s no celebrity involvedWell to be fair, if kobe wasn\\'t on the helicopter we\\'d be talking about no one. People die all the time and we don\\'t blink.Fix you broken immature thoughts.  Would we even know about the helicopter crash if it wasn\\'t for Kobe?  It is impossible to keep track and pay respect to every tragedy that occurs on a daily basis.  Kone was a public figure and the others were not, so of course we aren\\'t talking about them you twat.  Two people died in a car accident in my city yesterday, but you\\'re not talking about them.  You fucking monster!  stfu kid,.. welcome to lifeThe family members involved don’t give a shit what redditors upvote or talk about.Who cares your deadYou don\\'t get it because you\\'re an absolute moron. First, he was a very public figure and well known world-wide.  He wasn\\'t an ordinary millionaire.  Many people idolized him for what he was able to achieve in the world of basketball.  He gave more to charity than you will ever make.I feel sorry for you friends and family as they have to deal with your sociopathic shit.please dont forget that there are other people that died with them. rip to them too.Even if he did in the past didn’t he say sorry and became a better person after that? Judge a person for what he is in the present rather than their past. Bad people can become good people.Charges dropped. Settled in civil court, stfu.why is this weirdI have no idea too. but probabaly they where on their to go land.Yeah, and some confuse the valid practice of venting by wishing harm on someone with the invalid practice of threatening someone. Now in one recent case, someone told a white woman who dated a black man (which many find immoral/offensive) and had a child by him that he wished harm on her, and the cops got involved. They only targeted him for his opinion that IR sex is wrong, not because there was any threat to her. And while he merely wished harm and didn\\'t actually make a threat, they found evidence of a murder that he did commit.I know Calabasas and that is not Calabasas.Not a rapist. He was acquitted of all charges.They weren\\'t known so who cares right? God this celebrity thing is cancer.What are you talking about, you moron?Which nobody here has done...God I’ve been thinking about this all day. I echo your exact sentiment and hope it’s true.That would be cars actually.Ah, there will always be that one ignorant, degenerate piece of fucking filth who will always bring up this bullshit. Not surprisingNo. He was found innocent.[removed]Because people don’t get falsely accused of crimes they didn’t commit. Nice try though.If you’ve ever sat in LA traffic you wouldn’t question if it’s worth it to helicopter around. You sound insaneSo much anger. Get professional help pleaseRape never happenedNot sure but my cousin told me never use a helicopter as a common form of transportation (not that I could ever afford it) because she is an aviation mechanic and most all problems are with copters and single engine planesPlanes have more redundancy and without power they glide, helicopters fall.Was he ever convicted?What about the other man\\'s daughter?Kobe dying is a tragedy, but it hasn\\'t contributed to any world chaos.  Life will go on.nothing happened to the world man. its just normal eople die every day due to accidents and sickness. they just happen to be popular people whi happen to have influence others lives. world is still spinning so life goes on.Did he make themWell, it maybe because \"die\" is attributed to natural reasonsPeople are sad that someone who they know and is part of their lives died. Just because they didn’t shake his hand and play golf with him doesn’t mean they don’t know him. The tv and internet and movies and radio allow us to know far more people than those we interact with personally. We all know he was. He was a household name in every house in the world. Top 5 greatest athletes of modern times. This is a shock and tragedy to everyone who knew him.these men are JUGGERNAUTS. Kids got out of basketball practice sit and watch the game and see themselves in that same court. People idolize athletes because they strive to be in their position one day.Dude, three of his kids don\\'t have a father or sister anymore. Brought back feelings of my father dying. For fucks sake have a heartYou didn\\'t have to like him, but have some damn sympathy[Seating for five people](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ibidimages.incircuit.com/uploaded/2015-07/123331/008.jpg) in the passenger cabin.

There were two families affected. A rapist with influence and another entire family now gone. TMZ is just doing it\\'s job.I\\'m 35 and I might not be scared to die, but I\\'m definitely not ready to go yet! Very sobering indeedPeople who fly in helicopters a lot tend to have people predict their death in helicopter accidents[deleted]The other family who were the baseball coach, his wife and daughter have been talked about a lot.Nah gotta hit 81 millWhere did you see this?8,  not 3This is kinda niceCuz Reddit is extremely censoredFirst of all these allegations were never proven. Second of all just because someone made a mistake doesn’t make their death any less tragic.The girl was looking for a pay day.not true, Kobe was just more popular. More people knew him, therefore he’s getting more attention. It’s sad for all of the victims involved and their families.You don’t have to defend a rape in order to also believe someone was great at basketball. As an athlete he was perfect, as a person he was not. Both things can be true.He was put in a holding pattern for aircraft in gca for landing.[deleted]wooooah. that was .... good.You should feel very bad about yourself for that one. Take my upvote.Why would Obama address the nation? It’s not his job to break news.What\\'s a wolf Blitzer?I grew up in Newport Beach. Ton of us attended baseball camps ran by Coach Altobelli as kids. Very sad.My family’s had season tickets for almost 40 years. My first Laker games were during the 02-03 season as a 6 year old.That is Saudi Arabia, not California.na it\\'s notIt’s okay that you don’t care that someone you don’t know and don’t have an attachment to died. It isn’t normal behavior to chastise other people for feeling emotional at the story or a man dying in a helicopter with his young daughter.It\\'s always the same, one of the rich and famous died. And people who have ever seen him during his games or on TV are deeply affected. Bums frozen to death or local people they didn\\'t know well dying, that\\'s registered and forgotten within a minute.Outside the USA in Europe he isn\\'t all that well known. News reported nevertheless. But soccer is king, not basketball. Here people crack jokes about his name like he should have been named Biff Bryant if he was named after the beef. That would offend quite some people in the USA, over here he is for most just a basketball player with an odd name who crashed his helicopter.Address it by apologizing to her for being dismissive of her feelings, because you’re a robot.This is what gets me. Photos of him with his daughter kill me... I have a 22 month old. Hugged her extra tonight. Sad story all around.[deleted]How long is awhile?

What is she doing to help her community and the world ? Oh she must be squeaky clean, law abiding citizen.Rip Victims of the crashLMAOOO did you even read the whole story on that? The girl literally through herself at him. STRONG reading comprehension there.wow so edgyI hope you do.4:30 PM PT -- L.A. weather was extremely foggy Sunday morning, and law enforcement sources tell us even LAPD air support was grounded because of it. Flight tracker data shows Kobe\\'s chopper appeared to first encounter weather issues as it was above the L.A. Zoo. It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear.FLIGHT TOWER AUDIOWe know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA.At around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet.However, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 185mph.LeBron normally takes an upfitted sprinter van, it\\'s parked right by the delta suites entrancesI\\'m sure he rides in. If he was flying he\\'d get more hate than he already does.Ugh I hope this is not so, someone else’s error ending everyone’s lives. It’s not fair2.5 units of edginess have been added to your personality.Yea source??? Or stfuSource on it spreading in L.A.?This was faked. They used an app to called Carbon 2.5 to make the date appear as an older one. They did this for attention.[removed]Two of 9They give awards so stuff is popularized and shown more. It wasn\\'t an award honoring him for dying. It was awards to keep the post popular and relevant so all could see and mourn.Edit - shut nevermind. Never seen \"happy to see\" awards ... People are gross.In my opinion I think the closest in magnitude to this was Princess Diana’s death. This eclipses even micheal Jackson’sHe gave basketball everything he had. It was his first love. While a simple effort would have sufficed for many, Kobe dedicated his entire living being to it.Basically just saying the world wanted him for his skills and his drive on the court but in the end he gave them much more than anything that could be summed up on a basketball court.Amen brother .. or sister ..The act was consensual until he went for the butt. That’s when the problems started.Yeah the Denver Nuggets kept  getting their asses kicked by the lakers. So they made this elaborate rape scheme to get him off his Mamba mentality.  It didn’t work he just got betterI can’t say whether he’s guilty or not. He wasn’t convicted, but rich people have the means to avoid conviction more successfully than the rest of us.He says the encounter was consensual. The accuser says it was rape. Criminal case was dropped when accuser refused to testify. The accuser later filed a civil suit against Kobe, which was settled out of court, and Kobe apologized to the accuser but did not admit to rape.You can find sources for more details. Again, I can’t say either way whether he actually raped her or not.His accuser didn\\'t testify in court and the case was thrown outLol if you\\'re going to blame God when things go wrong, you are equally obliged to praise Him when things go right, billions and billions of times per second[removed]You can’t empathize with people who were affected by his death. Many of them were lifelong fans, who got into basketball, sports (instead of other outlets in life) because of him. Basketball is an gateway for so many people. Kobe is a global icon who inspired an entire generation of athletes with his absolute insane Mamba Mentallity work ethic, who honed his craft so much he was legendary in it. He gave a city his blood sweat and tears and he deserves the upmost respect in mourning from people who felt touched by him in one way or another.I’m so sorry, make sure you talk to a grief counselor as soon as possible. Don’t be afraid to feel your feelings. Hugs*Ask for help if you need it. And give yourself some time.

Just devastating.My thoughts exactly, Kobe was a treasure, but all lives lost are a tragedy. Too bad that each casualty wont be recognized the same. RipNah but ur sister is and we just matched.. gonna link in a fewToday is not the day. I know people want to make a rape that allegedly happened almost 20 years ago more important than the sum total of a human being\\'s life, but let\\'s try to keep it in perspective.English not your thing?The word you\\'re thinking of is \\'murdered.\\' He definitely was killed in the crash.> the fear of plummeting to earth holding your loved ones knowing your going to die is unfathomable to me, my thoughts and prayersTake comfort in that from all I\\'ve read about the crash the victims most likely never saw what was coming and went from living to dead in less than a second.Happened very fast, who knows if they knew.Maybe if we felt the loss of any life as keenly as we felt the death of those close to us, human history would be a lot less bloody.I don’t think people don’t care as you’re implying. Kobe Bryant was a part of a lot of people’s lives. For those who follow and play sports, his name is synonymous with the game of basketball. In the US basketball is a way to escape, grow, learn, and so much more. Kobe was a generational talent that impacted so many peoples lives. Sure he doesn’t know and never met 99.9% of the people mourning his loss, but he was a part of their lives. He gave the fans 20 years and for him to die so tragically is beyond words. Just let people mourn and come to terms with his death. Also, let us not forget the other 8 victims. Have a good night man.[deleted]Stfu this man was so much more than an athlete you clearly don’t understandStay classy, asshole.[removed]Supposedly he used it while playing too, because he got stiff if he had to drive/get stuck in two hour traffic before a game. Very tragic stuff.he was known for traveling to his games in a helicopterA typical aircraft, from an engineering standpoint, is actually a far more complex machine than a helicopter.It is actually the simplicity of helicopters that make it far more susceptible to weather, and a lot harder to correct if control is lost.IFR conditions. Dense fog. This Sikorsky is the top of the line, dual engine, safest helicopter in the world. Used for Air Ambulances and Off Shore Oil Rigs where flights over water prohibit auto-rotation landings.The pilot slammed into the side of a mountain at 161 knots in complete fog.  No problem with the machine.Actually 9 people died, and it’s tragic for all of them. No need to be a white knight today. Kobe just happened to be the most famous and recognized of them and he meant a lot to many people all over the world.[removed]Haha fuck offYou’re an ass.They’re not much more dangerous than drivingDamn. Remembering always doing that in the younger days just added another layer of sadness 😭Let me guess, \"Never mind that he\\'s dead, a rape occurred twenty years ago so we have to bitch about it some more!\" People have zero perspective.The mean, angry side of the internet resides there.

Not too surprising there is at least one joke made about this unfortunate event at some point.well, i fucking hate that. is this the new \"simpsons predicts the future\"?[deleted]Fuck off white knight, he was never convicted and his accuser was really sketchy.The crazy thing is the helicopter that  crashed was supposedly one of the safest on the market. And the pilot also had a good flying record.You’re pretty edgy bud.Then why are you here edgelord? You sound butthurtThis article was written hours ago when all we knew was that he was in a crashNot feasible.Wouldn\\'t have helped. The chopper wasn\\'t configured for parachute jumps, the passengers wouldn\\'t have had time to get a chute on before it was too late.[deleted]It was 1 daughter, not 3.I felt exactly like that when AVICII died. It gets better but you never truly get over it altogether.NBA and Los Angeles basketball will never be the sameIf the reports are right, it sounds like they thought they were clear. It sounds like they didn’t anticipate impact because the speed was so high, 185 mph. I know nothing about flying a helicopter, just based on other comments here. So It sounds possible they didn’t even know they were in danger.I was thinking the same thing. I just think helicopter crashes happen so fast you probably don’t think scenarios through plus his type of helicopter had doors and was more compact then say those open, smaller ones so I would assume it would be harder to get out.185mph, good luck.No we don\\'t.Here’s three of them:[family](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thespun.com/more/top-stories/john-altobelli-wife-daughter-killed-crash-kobe-bryant/amp)Oh get off your high horse.

In Los Angeles traffic, that might be a 2.5 hour drive.  In a helicopter going ~140 knots it\\'s probably about a 30 minute trip.  Unfortunately, it seems that they hit bad weather (heavy fog) and the pilot was trying to follow the highway, circled around LAX at one point due to flight traffic, then attempted to continue the flight.  Looks like they crashed shortly after that.Good lordVintage Stock:   Are you in Tulsa?[removed]Every once in a blue moon, a figure that has surpassed what most people achieve in their life, dies in an unexpected way. The world mourns the loss of someone so accomplished. It makes us take a step back and realize we are all human. Now how often is it that their young teenage child was with? This one hurts. Please keep your opinions at a minimum and let people mourn an important figure and his innocent daughter, along with 7 others who also perished.r/iamverybadassHey atleast his wife can join the NFL as a linebacker.

Pilot probably was over confident in his skill set or lack confidence in his IRF skill set (hence the altitude drop looking for visual land confirmation).If you\\'re a pilot getting bossed around by a passenger...you shouldn\\'t be a pilot. No excuses...unless that passenger is the presidentThey kept converging on the section of the crash that was smoking.  At one point there was someone up there with a camera (likely a coroner).   They were taking photos in that area quite a bit.   I wonder if that’s where Kobe was. Like you; I hope it doesn’t get leaked.  But if the past tells you anything; it very well may get leaked.I forget which channel but they briefly mentioned a black box had been retrieved. I guess its important?[deleted]And here you are.....solving the worlds problems on redditI’ve never cried like I have today. Every tribute, every new photo, and all the messages.

Although he could be sincere, I’m just surprised he didn’t tack on something blatantly heartless or cruel at the end.Why are you trying to look for something bad? Warmest condolences just means nice condolences. Coldest condolences sounds worse. Why do you people try to look for some hidden make believe message in everything the man says?

I don\\'t think he was the greatest husband at first, but I hope he was good after all the initial issues.Probably because he wasnt convicted?The fuck.Just try sorting by controversial . . .humans are the common factorPessimism isn’t helpful.  People die all the time.  Just because you know the name doesn’t make it more important.  You didn’t know him personally.   There is always outbreaks.   More people have died from the normal flu this year than the media frenzied coverage of the China outbreak, war was been happening. Nothing new.I fucking detest flying machines honestly. Heli\\'s are a total no go for me.no. doggy isHeavy fogTo be fair, we haven’t had their names officially released and it’s just respectful to keep quiet until that is done[deleted][deleted]People who hate Kobe.      I can’t think of a single good reason why the death of a basketball champion would make anyone ‘smile’.I’ve never had subway in Portugal but I’ve been many times they have this other sandwich shop kinda like subway but I forget what it’s called and they offer lots of sandwiches with hard boiled eggs on them and I really enjoy them whenever I’m in Portugal but I havnt been in almost ten years so I always forget what it’s called I believe they have yellow brown green logo? With triangles or something lol sorry I know this is about Kobe :(. But you of all people should know the name of this chain of shops. They were all over Aveiro I believe they were in Porto as well but I spend most of my time in aveiroSeriously. Have been following since it was first announced. Doesn’t seem real. I’m by no means a die hard lakers or Kobe fan. But this dude was every 90’s boys idol. Incredible sad day for his family and for those on board.When I see his face on the news it is making me nauseousWasn\\'t it one daughter?[deleted], and sister/daughter.God wears Kobe Sandals.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe\\\\_Bryant\\\\_sexual\\\\_assault\\\\_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant_sexual_assault_case)It\\'s mostly there. Very hard to understand what happened IMO. It does sound like fairly forced sex. But yeah who the fuck knows but those two.Hi, go fuck yourself. ThanksDude a child died fuck offYour god does not exist, “god” exists but not the one you thinkYou’re a terrible personno one cares what you thinkThat\\'s great. You\\'re entitled to your opinion. But what is the need in commenting this? Do you want a medal for your \"bravery\"?It was his personal aircraft. He probably flew it constantly.Nice ideaI don\\'t exactly get what you mean, please ELI5and over 150 awardsMost likely, it’s not awarding the poster for being the first person to post about a notable death. People are paying for awards on the post to honor 24.My father is a helicopter pilot. He said helicopters are not very forgiving and you must sometimes make decisions in a split second and there’s no second chances. He guessed the weather was bad, foggy, pilot got disoriented and either hit a hill or wire. He also said “The debris field looks like they were going at a good clip. I still think they hit something. Might have clipped a cell phone tower. Chopper will fly without tail rotor as long as you have altitude and airspeed. Aircraft streamlines and you bring it in for running landing. Did it a few times.”[deleted]Probably mechanical failure. Who knowsWe won\\'t know yet.... but see belowIt has been reported that there was heavy fog and that an air controller advised the pilot that they were flying too low.Most likely human error caused by bad weather. It looks like they flew into fog and hit the hillside.Nothing official but it seems weather and human errorFog seems to be a factorIm so sorry[deleted]/r/gatekeeping would like a word with what people are and aren’t allowed to spend money on which posts to guild.Find other things to care about.[deleted]He who made them just killed them.Fuck off.Get fucked with your death cult.[deleted]>You just showed your hand.Is my hand not liking rapists? Cause ya. Here\\'s my hand.Made of? Cynicism at worst, yes, do I want to join the bandwagon and pretend someone was a great human being for being good at a sport? No. A cheater, a rapist, and give it a few years and who knows how much more will be unearthed, fact of the matter is that we all want to believe our heroes die as great man, and sadly that’s just something to tell ourselves and others so we pretend their sins didn’t happen, but they did, and instead of us focusing on the singular person on that helicopter why not focused on every single other person that also died on this day and give them a bit of attention so it’s not all overshadowed and wrote down as the day we lost Kobe, and not all those poor other people.[deleted]Well fucking said.Agreed. Furthermore, he never raped the woman. He’s guilty of cheating on his wife but not rape.Bro people make all kinds of strange comments around death. I do too as well when parents or family die. People just like to joke to take the pain away. It\\'s awful in some ways.Now of course people who are just mean and weird are something else entirely.I see it as a compliment to the guy. A generation of basketball fans wanted to be him, and dreamed of doing so while doing silly shit like that.That poor woman, and their other children. It’s horrific.What’s the difference to you?It’s been confirmedIncredible how dumb and disrespectful people can be. Please don\\'t reproduce.He was an inspiration to many people. Sorry you have no one to look up to in your life loser. No need to be bitter.What does purple and yellow have anything to do with it? The reaction would be exactly the same if he played for any teamHa and you are the guy getting mad at adults for celebrating a guy for wearing purple and yellow via Reddit, hows your life hahaWho’s celebrating his death?you get free points when u upvote as wellGrowing up in LA, he was such an icon, like a walking monument. What a loss, I can’t believe it.citing your editnever ask questions on reddit people just downvote youEarly reports suggest it was going 185 mph on impact.Was probably traveling over 130mph on impactMy mind im until proven otherwise is the cloud coverage was bad, and they hit the hill and no one knew what happened.  I dont want to imagine what itd be like with a helicopter going down and you know its coming , and i certainly cant fathom having to watch that and seeing you\\'re daughter there.  It sucks.  Quick and painless and ignorant.  PleaseSala didn’t die in a helicopter accident, it was a small aircraftWell the helicopter disintegrated on impact. So my best guess is they died on impact.Yes we do>Most people outside of US don’t know who this person isYou know you don\\'t have to comment all the time. It\\'s good to shut the fuck up once in a while, even on the internet.Are you for real?The man was everywhere and that was well before the era of social media.He also starred in many console games that were smash hits.Ignorance at its finestAre you kidding me.  I have family from Iran  contacting me about himKobe is worldwide.  China is very big on basketball so obviously they know who he is.  Kobe also started out playing basketball in Europe so he is well known in the Spain/Italy area.fucking ignorant, he was one of the best basketball players ever. Nobody outside the US knows who Jordan or LeBron are?The internet sometimes is not to be taken serious. Don\\'t worry pal. Let\\'s just grieve this horrible tragedy and move forward.Agreed, Reddit can be disgusting sometimes.[deleted]He was attempted to be charged but they were dropped in 2003.I dunno - was he ever convicted of rape?insensitive prickSo they tell him to listen to 134.2 and he responds with 34.2.  No more communication. What else does all this mean?i know little to nothing about aviation tracking, but jesus this gave me chillsGave me goosebumps.[deleted]Yeah they didn\\'t feel or really even know a thing. It just hit them. The most anybody would have time for is a yell most likely before nearly instant death.Terrifying. I don\\'t know much about this things but are there any rules about not flying in certain condition? Or is it more at the decision of the pilot?Usually when the search party can\\'t even be dispatched because of bad weather that\\'s a solid indicator to terrible Aeronautical Decision Making from the pilots side.Obviously the pilot couldn’t navigate by instruments, so sad.People die in cars dailyhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/are-helicopters-safe-how-they-stack-up-against-planes-cars-and-trains/I used to run into Vanessa, Gigi, and Natalia at a supermarket near Newport/Laguna Beach. They were little then, adorable and polite. So sad.How did Kobe know Italian? Interesting.It’s sad the world has turned into this on what’s probably an honest mistake. Go look at her explanation.Emergency response people in L.A. know they can cal TMZ and sell the info so they can break the story. Sounds fucked up but tmz is just getting the info from the inside.TMZ is basically the celebrity feds lol.  They stalk like crazy.[deleted]Ask your motherSame :( I don’t watch basketball but he’s just one of those icons that you think will be around forever[deleted]Well put.Don’t forget that mere hours after he passed, you hopped on Reddit to be a sad loser because you had nothing better to doA Vietnam vet gave me the same sage advice.Thanks for this. Such a shame.Edit: TMZ reporting the final speed of the heli was around 186mph. Hopefully no one suffered.If this any consolation, I don’t think they had the slightest time to think or act.Authorities and bystanders said the crash was almost instantaneous.this just hit me so hard. you\\'re absolutely right.[deleted][deleted]This got out early on, I’m sad to see it confirmedApparently due to fog they flew into a mountain at near full speedThe only time I ever wore a parachute in a helicopter was when we were deliberately parachuting out of them.The other 100+ times? No parachute.helicopters generally fly pretty low, i don\\'t think you\\'d even have time to pull a parachuteYup.  The punishment for infidelity is death next to your 13 year old daughter.  It\\'s in the Constitution.You’re disgustingThe nihilist in me agrees. No lives matter.Stop whiteknighting, this is what always happens when a big celeb dies and is a completely normal human reaction.>Oh look at me... I\\'m ultra altruistic and even more thoughtful than all of you.Fart.... And whiff.... Fart.... Waft and whiff.People didn’t feel like they had a connection with other people.Remarkable! Thousands of other human beings have died today as well, and yet not one single mention of them in these comments! I\\'ve scrolled for hours and not one person except for me thinks to offer their condolences to all the many victims of cancer, heart disease, suicide, and other causes of death. My condolences to ALL families affected by death, sickness, disease, or any other hardship. Unlike the other peasants here, I don\\'t just care about people who impacted my life, I care about everyone! I am better than all of you, now give me upvotes[removed]I mentioned 3 others. A former UH baseball player (was a college coach in CA, I believe), his wife and daughter. But not as much information on the others have come out yet. No one is discounting the other lives lost.They haven’t been identified. There are no other names to mention, other than the gentleman who was a college baseball coach.To be honest, most people probably didnt know more passengers were involved. I certainly didn’t til now.I thought the same thing but those people are private citizens and not public figures. We didn\\'t watch them grow up from 17 years old... Nobody is forgetting or dismissing the other victims we just don\\'t know anything about them yet... If one of the other people involved was Shaq for example... Millions would care but we don\\'t know what to say or who they are.... I could go on and on but let\\'s not make this about \"people ignoring the other victims\" because that\\'s not the case at all.tons of mentions. Kobe, his daughter, a teammate of his daughter\\'s, that girl\\'s father, a U of H alumni, his wife and daughter, and pilot. I am missing someone but the info is all in the commentsThis comment doesn’t make you more righteous than anyone else. Of corse Kobe is going to get the headlines because he’s the most recognized name.You must be great at funerals.This is exactly why everyone hates you trump idiots.Dude, keep that shit in your political subreddits or whatever private one they have for you in Russia.So using \"no clip\" would have saved a few lives here...Basically grinding them all into pulp at high speed. I remember seeing pics of a woman it happened to in a biplane accident.They may have been traveling at over 130mph when they hit groundIt’s completely normal to have those thoughts. I would guess it would be pretty instant. That said, if they knew they were going down, I can’t imagine the horror that they were experiencing inside that cabin, that would have been probably worse than the actual dying part.No, in these types of crashes  they probably had 5 seconds of hOlY ShIt watch out for that mountain! Sometimes they survive the crash and the fireball cooks the rest of the survivors.This is not the time for that.Stop making shit upConfessed to what? Link?Somebody hours ago claimed his sister was in the crash and nobody believed him but he said her name was Christina and I think he was right. I can’t find the comment.[Source](https://abc13.com/former-uh-baseball-player-killed-in-california-helicopter-crash/5880911/)That\\'s not what this article saysThis hasn’t been widely reported yet.

[Source](https://abc13.com/former-uh-baseball-player-killed-in-california-helicopter-crash/5880911/)Yeah, i feel the same way especially upvoting something in r/trashy or r/ChoosingBeggarsIt doesn\\'t mean you like it or are happy he died. You can just upvote something because it\\'s significant or important.After losing a parent, two cousins all of my grandparents, and several friends.The fragility of life doesn\\'t scare me anymore. Pretty soon there will be nobody left for me to want to stay here.They don\\'t crash as often as you probably think, but as a helicopter pilot I can give you a little insight: Helicopters are more difficult to fly in demanding situations and are very vulnerable to slight mechanical issues that aren\\'t as fatal for fixed-wing aircraft. Plenty of helicopters have crashed due to poor airmanship, and plenty have crashed because of poor maintenance, whereas fixed-wing aircraft are generally more forgiving to poor airmanship because they are further from the ground most of the time, and are aerodynamically stable, whereas helicopters are not. Most mechanical issues in fixed-wing aircraft do not result in the destruction of the aircraft. I can think of very few issues like that for fixed-wing aircraft. Helicopters, however, are constantly balancing on a very thin edge between \"in-control\" and \"out-of-control\", and even slight disturbances to that balance can be fatal. If a jack-screw comes out somewhere in my tail rotor system, it\\'s very possible that I lose all control of the tail rotor, which will likely result in my complete lack of control of the helicopter. The best I can hope for is a very hard landing which will likely roll the helicopter over and destroy it.Very few airplanes have such small tolerances for mechanical failures.The main problem is that with an airplane, if you lose engine power, you can glide down and your chances of survival are fairly high, in a helicopter, the very thing that provides the lift for it is powered by the engine. Helicopters glide like rocks. Dipped in lead. If you lose engine power in a helicopter, you’re not gonna have a good time. Even Captain Sully couldn’t make a helicopter with a dead engine fly.....but we don’t know the cause of this incident yet. I’m hearing the weather was not ideal for flying that morning and that other aircraft had been grounded.Yes, let’s tell stories about how the other 8 souls affected our lives and how we shall remember them. You go first.They haven’t been named and it’s not right to focus on them when their next of kin at may not have been notifiedThanks for sharingWow, 161 knots? That’s 185mph, why would they be going that last.I believe there are a few landing pads in Griffith Park. I wonder why they wouldn’t just land.Kobe didn’t rape shitI know it was more than likely PR, but the statement that came out of it later on was very well put. He acknowledged it was not consensual. And the fact that he tried to give back a lot, especially to women’s basketball, might be tied to that. He was also the father to four daughters, so he may have had a wake up call at some point. I’m not saying he was a saint, and I’m not minimizing what the poor woman went through both during the incident and in the aftermath where she was dragged through the mud by lawyers and the media.But he did seem more balanced after this, so one might hope he repented along the way.From TMZ:>4:30 PM PT -- L.A. weather was extremely foggy Sunday morning, and law enforcement sources tell us even LAPD air support was grounded because of it. Flight tracker data shows Kobe\\'s chopper appeared to first encounter weather issues as it was above the L.A. Zoo. It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear.We know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA.At around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet.However, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 161 knots.The NTSB will investigate.Hahaha. Your profile is gold.  What a terrible human you are. POS. Lol dildoGo back to posting your memes kidYikes budReally? You’re a fucking clown.Yes, apparently.Because some people are sociopaths.Because people can\\'t fathom the thought of a big celebrity dyingAt 12:21 his heading looks like it goes crazy and his airspeed drops.    Thanks for posting that link.[deleted]> Just left downtown Los Angeles near the staples center. Thousands are heading down to staples center to celebrate the legend.Also the Grammys.9 passengers also. TMZWho is reporting that?  there\\'s multiple comments like this if you sort by new claiming that it\\'s \"now being reported his wife was on board\" or it\\'s \"now being reported his 17 year old daughter was on board\" and then I Google it and nothing comes up.Who is reporting this?!omg i hope not!!! where did you read that?Yes, but \"he thought it was consensual sex\". He admitted to it.  He paid her to drop charges. Made her out to be some psycho. Fans wanna forget it happened at all.No. She filed a lawsuit and dropped it as soon as she got paid.Really? You couldnt just google it?Their baby girl is now 7 months old.What in God\\'s name are you talking about?One day this comment will make you cringe I hopeDo poor unknown people not die during their commute too?Far more people die in cars than helicoptersmore people die in car crashes than air crashes. people die in their commute every day, by the thousands.I think that video has been proven to be from a previous crashI dont know what clip you saw but there is a clip circulating claiming to be of this tragedy, but it is **not**. The clip is from 2018 and is not from this horrible event todayAlmost infinite realities out there where much worse and much better happened.No shit if you don’t know them how is it possible to care. This kind of comment is uselessMaybe because we didn\\'t know themAnd RIP to the 8 other people on board that chopper that weren’t Kobe.[removed]No, it’s life, people from all walks of life die every single day. There are just more people in the spot light, so it might seem that way.Definitely don\\'t click this video, but for others curious he\\'s what your comment is like from a go pro camera.[https://youtu.be/TMhHjh8xhrE](https://youtu.be/TMhHjh8xhrE)You must be young if this is the first one[deleted]Umm, you might wanna add the 7 others to your eulogy[deleted]Unless you’re playing against people from Asia then it’s Yao Ming in my experienceThanks for sharing, I can imagine thatWhat does that have to do with anything?Eyewitness accounts heard engine trouble, but still whatever happened happened pretty quickBecause people are happy that a \"rapist\" diedit\\'s obvious he was set up by a girl who wanted to profit off himhe still cheated on his wife, but he didn\\'t rape this womanDoesn’t have a son.Doesn’t have a son.Yeah, she was confirmed not on the flight.I have been wondering the same thing.I\\'d like to think so but the game of basketball likely won\\'t be around in 500 years let alone people remembering a guy who played.There is video on YouTube. Clear sky. Something falls off/out of the heli and then it spins uncontrolled into the ground.[deleted]I don’t know anything about helicopters, but can’t you land a helicopter basically on anything somewhat level?[deleted]Was thinking the same, a foggy morning for a heli ride to practice was a bad call>I don’t think flying around in a helicopter near the mountains in the fog was such a good idea.You felt the need to say that, huh? What a fun guy.That is why they invented Instrument flying....Hahaha. Your profile is gold.  What a terrible human you are. LolHahaha. Your profile is gold.  What a terrible human you are. LolWtf?  We don\\'t have to be super fans or even fans to see that this is a tragedy. Like you are somehow special because you were a fan like literally millions of other people.  The man was a legend, at least one 13 year old girl is gone, his family is grieving and the rest of us can have empathy and be sad about this tragedy.Go fuck yourself.>This is not Kobe specific. This happened with Michael Jackson. Prince. And many others. 90% are not fans by any stretch, but the celebrity dies and suddenly everyone is a superfan. RIP Kobe. To all you posers, you are big pieces of shit.Stay classy.Since when do you need to be a superfan to recognize that someone was, objectively, a legend and had a major impact in our culture? ffs, things like this happening bring us together as a society. Why are you so elitist about itr/gatekeepingYeah this is 100% the time and place to get on that high horse. Congrats, you look 1000 times worse than the ones you went at.I mean can’t they just appreciate the guy whether they were big fans before or not?[deleted]Kobe was a household name that most knew even if they never met him, aka a celebrity. I’m sure the families and friends of the other 7 are devastated but the average person is not going to know who they are and I’m sure the media will learn the names in the next 24hrs after the families are informed. You sound jealous and bitterMy God people, don’t jump to conclusions!They have to verify their identities and contact the families first. Kobe’s reps confirmed his and Gigi’s passing, the rest have to be properly identified and their families shielded from the media circus.Not the time.Funny guy. Someone get this guy the comedian of the year award. 🙄Been watching news all day.  Not once have I seen thisIt wasn\\'t engine failure.  The data shows the helicopter was speeding up.  The S-76B also has two engines.The pilot was flying VFR (visual) when they should have been flying IFR (instrument).  They were scud running and crashed into a hill.  Unfortunate, but not uncommon.  They had get there ites\"Weather observations from the crash area indicated low clouds and restricted visibility, which may have obscured high terrain.\" - Washington Post[deleted]it was confirmed 9 total in the press conference.Probably a smart move.Don\\'t think they found him guilty of that if I remember correctly.That was debunked hours ago, fuck offGo to hell you sick individualI mean that usually applies to people burning themselves out on drugs... not freak helicopter crashes.How unimaginably awful. I’m so sorry.Internet hugs my guy. Sad dayI’m so sorry. Horrible tragedy, my heart goes out to you.Man that must of been a tough oneThat’s rough man. I’m sorry to hear that.Forgot the s/?There are blades above you and the resistance hurls you upward if you have a parachute - the helicopter that weighs a ton will be falling rapidly with spinning blades and you will be suspended in the air and chopped to pieces.Parachutes aren\\'t very useful in a helicopter.That would not have helpedI’ve been thinking about this all dayToo bad jesus didn’t take the wheel so he wouldn’t die.Jesus wears Kobe’s sandalsI think they’d have spent their last moments confused as to why their helicopter turned into a plane. But that will undoubtedly be the cause of the crash.It was over quickly, if that gives them any comfort.  I doubt they had more than a minute of knowledge before the crash - and they only knew it was coming if the pilot said something.  (It is club car seating in the back so half the occupants would be facing the tail)[removed]Spoken like a person who never tried to like sports their whole life. Probably cause you sucked at them, but that’s neither here nor there. He could very well be a hero to kids who looked up to him, and inspired them to play basketball rather than be on the streets or doing something unhealthy. To say he wasn’t a hero to anyone is stupid and ignorant.People die every day, young sports legends don\\'t. I\\'m not sure why this is hard for people like you to understand.    Christ, either give your sympathies or shove off.      >This stuff happens every dayThanks for the new insightful information!> People are way to into sportsSports is hardly the only space where fame does weird things to both people in it and people around it. Human society gets pretty damn irrational sometimes.That said, needless death is a tragedy regardless. No reason to throw mud onto someone else\\'s funeral.That’s because they aren’t public figures and people wait until it’s official and confirmed that their next of kin has been notified.Kobe loved  those helicopters.  He used to use one to fly in from OC on game day at the Forum.And what probably seemed like an awesome, fun thing to do.He was comparing the state of shocked when Magic announced his HIV diagnosis. Remember at the time of his announcement having HIV/Aids was basically a death sentence.I think its more like Princess Diana\\'s death.I just feel so awful for her. This was supposed to be the good years - nothing to do but enjoy their wealth and their children.There is video of him landing in LA  and walking off team planeVicious rumor spreading my man...I doubt something that big could slip under the radar this long. If anything I\\'d imagine he is in person with the family or something.Flying into LA from the East Coast.Grow upPlease update the info.Weather.   Fog/clouds concealed the mountaintop a according to the reports.  Slammed right into that mountaintop.She’s got a seven month old to take care of.  That baby likely hasn’t even taken his first step yet. Such a tragedyThey crashed, most likely, because of pilot errorAs for the age, you most likely fly on commercial airlines that are 10-15 years old with a hell of lot more flying hours then that helicopter.   Helicopters are not \\'notoriously dangerous\\'It seems like they\\'re blaming the pilot moreso than the helicopter failing.Seems like they think it was a human error from the pilotThe pilot, most likely, crashed into terrain because he was flying VFR instead of IFR (flying visually instead of on instruments).Fog was reported in the area.The flight data that was posted, assuming it\\'s accurate, makes it look like they did a little spin and got stuck in a canyon due to bad weather.  So either confusion from poor visibility, or equipment failure at a terrible time and location.Police haven\\'t released their names yet as per policy before the investigation is completed. Only reason we know it\\'s Kobe is because media follows his every movecould be kids and parents on his daughter\\'s bball team :/supposedly they were heading to a game or practice session over at the Mamba Academy in nearby Thousand Oaks. Just heart-wrenching.CNN just confirmed via family member that the OCC coach, his wife and his daughter were also on board.An oCC baseball coach (possibly his daughter)And the wife of a band member.   Some names have been mentioned throughout this thread.your right they don’tbut at least 2 others were a parent and their child[removed]maybe because they want to notify the families first ?“Boy, everyone’s an idiot but me”Nice! Thanks for letting us know about your shitty life! Very cool!God you must have a shitty life.Then why waste everyone\\'s time by commenting? What a cunt way to go through life.[deleted]Then why comment?cars just don\\'t crashMost likely it will be pilot error.The initial data is that there was fog, they did not file IFR, and they hit terrain.   It looks like they tried to pull up at the last minute.It was an old helicopterWhat a shame if true, that a Legend and his child gone because of a pilot making a \"risky maneuver\"Helicopter was operating good, pilot had fog to deal with, he was going around hills at very low altitudes and took a risk to just keep going, sometimes it doesn\\'t work out well.Check on r/helicopters for a plausible theory. Basically, it appears to be fog. Some final destination shit.It’s not official but on my local news they said supposedly a fire happened on board which caused the helicopter to go out of controlOnce again it’s not official but that’s what they saidit was foggy today in cali, that’s all I heardIt was not a mid-air collusion, but it was fast (if that gives comfort). I doubt the passengers knew until the last 30 seconds.Reports mentioned that someone on the ground heard the engine sputtering before crashingThat was debunked hours ago, fuck offFake newsNone of us can. It’s insane news . We’re all in disbeliefKobe always used a helicopter since he became rich from what I\\'ve heard...helicopters aren\\'t as safe as planesHave you driven in LA ? Irvine to Thousand Oaks is 80 miles.  You have to cross LA to get there....They rich they can[deleted]I think it\\'s terrible that his 13 year old daughter was killed. However, he was some rapist who tossed a ball through a hoop.

THey are just significantly more expensive per hour so the people who tend to die in them are more famous.Traveling by air seems to be especially dangerous if you are a sports star or a singer...Pro pro tip: do not ever use your car.  It is way more dangerous than a helicopter.[deleted]The chopper was solar and wasted no fossil fuels. Downside is, it was cloudy and it crashed 🙉Rich people man, they’re the ones dying in plane/chopper crashes. It’s weird that you can so successful that you *introduce* those dangers into your life.Newport Beach to Thousand Oaks is nearly a two hour drive...True but it’s not the time to discuss that.This is not the time to be on your global warming high horseNot the time or the placeThese aren’t mutually exclusive you twat.Dude that’s so weird I was literally thinking this same thing not long after hearing about thisFuck man. Kobe most likely be alive if he used limos instead of helis.Going to be interesting to hear what he says on the podcast.Bill Barr otoh, please fly by helicopter every day[removed][deleted][deleted]Looks nothing like the actual area this happened in.His helicopter was blueFake. Video is from DubaiNoMaybe they should put this on a sticky.There was fog. You would not be able to see the crash.They also, most likely, crashed into terrain.This is not it.Trump is still your president, lmao. Stay saltyThe next 5 years are going to be tough for you.How the hell do you not understand what upvoting is after at least 5mo on reddit?Upvote is not the same thing as a like. Upvotes are for visibility/promoting discussion.Upvoting is not liking. It\\'s to bring awarenessPeople should understand that it was probably not possible to have a video footage.  They crashed *because of fog*Obv fake, but seriously dude? Your first thought is \"oh shit, I gotta look up a video of this dude dying\"NoThey were in heavy fog.You would not be able to see the crash.  They also, most likely, flew it into land.Nope. Not it.Nice Norm McDonald pull.Rest in peace in peace KobeFor sure. I’ve never been an NBA fan (college basketball is where it’s at for me), but Kobe is a legend and as someone who grew up in the 2000’s his name and accomplishments are things I’ve always known.This is another name along with the OCC baseball coach and likely his daughter. Geez.colin mcrae iirc was actually showing off his piloting skills and ended up killing around 4 peopleI respect him and his career but endangering people’s lives is one of the shittiest things you can doStevie Ray Vaughn died In a helicopter crash as wellThis is the video I was watching:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SFil1ljcygYou better name that dog Kobe.I think you have to get the dog and name it Kobe now[deleted]Are you stupid? People cared about Kobe, they were his fans, and athletes everywhere, even in the NFL, were inspired by how hard he worked. No shit people are upset, Kobe had an incredible positive impact on the sports culture of this country. No one ever gave a crap about pedophile Epsteinit bothers people because they are emotionally attached to kobe, no one gave a shit for epstein’s well being and the only thing we wanted was answersand his death had months of news coverage and he is still in the news regularlyEpstein was a dirt bag covering up for other dirt bags.Oh my god just shut the fuck upEpstein is a billionaire people recently found out has a pedophilia ringKobe Bryant is a recently retired all time great of the basketball sport. He is a a generational talent, icon, mentor and much moreIt\\'s much more emotional as we\\'ve seen.The general populous watches more sports than politics. That’s just how the US is. Especially now, with the circus that is US politics.[deleted]Talking about the case where the chick dropped it because she wouldn\\'t testify because she knew she was lying?His death was due to a mechanical failureHelicopter death rate is not that much different the GA death rate (1.5 more per hour).  However, Helicopters are 5-20x more expensive to operate per hour.  Therefore - most people you know who die in GA helicopters are rich...Far far more have died by car, should they walk instead?Because vehicular traffic is for plebs. But yeah, air travel is dangerous.Leicester City**The owner of Leicester city died in a helicopter crash a year ago.Leicester City.Same. Mom doesn\\'t GAF about sports and was sad by thisIt’s JanuaryA court said otherwise.....Not an expert here, but I see they were circling a few times after some point in the midway, any reason why?ughh if it was human error then whyyyy pilot! sadly the pilot perished too so all around sad situation:([deleted][deleted]The fact it was so preventable makes this even worse.[deleted]Controlled flight into terrainI have no horse in the game cause those were allegations that were settled but I am very curious why you feel so strongly about people calling him out on it.Rape\\'s not some random teeny tiny mistake everyone does. I can guarantee you when Bill Cosby dies, people will be spitting on his grave.His victim is still alive. His death does not absolve the suffering she faced at his hands.The helicopter destroyed him already. There’s no need for us to do it.No. All I have to say is that Kobe Bryant raped a young woman and ruined her life and walked away scot free.I mean I hope they never get rapedI don’t think the comment destroyed him, but it shouldn’t be forgotten while recalling his lifeif there is a god he\\'s a real dick headKeep the religious vs antireligious arguments for the appropriate subs. This is a tragedy not a debate forum.Regardless, all his stuff is going to skyrocket.Two golds, China 2008 and London 2012There actually isThere is a way.  YouTube has videos of how it\\'s done.  Rumors are saying it was low visibility and the pilot didn\\'t fly by instrument and went straight into the hillside.Not true. It’s called autorotation https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutorotationThere is actually a way to glide, please inform yourself before stating this (autorotation)I\\'m Irish too and I\\'m stunned by the news, hearing about his daughter being with him is just so incredibly heartbreakingFlying is arguably safer than drivingHe’s said in previous things, like a past GQ piece, that sitting for 2+ hours in a car in traffic like that actually hurts his body from all the wear and tear from basketball and the injuries. So, that’s why.Driving is not much safer honestly.[deleted]He was going from Irvine to Thousand Oaks, so was not that nearby.He takes a Helicopter because he can.What about his daughter?There was fog.I highly doubt you saw a video.the video is fake.That video on Twitter is from a different crash over a year ago in the Middle East.I think that it was debunked that the video that’s circulating is that of Kobe’s helicopter crashWhere is the video?[deleted]How do you not know the global phenemenom household name KOBE!You sleepingWhat do you want, a cookie? Why comment?Totally agreeBut it was reported by several outlets that the helicopter was caught on fire before crashing?News conference said they won’t make an official announcement until all next of kin were notified. They also ripped TMZ for not following that process.One of them was his 13 year old daughter GiannaThe current reports are saying that his daughter Gianna, one of her teammates and her teammate\\'s parent were all in the helicopterThis is the equivalent of saying that cars should only be used for emergency situations only because there was a tragic car accident.Yes.  Furthermore, we should be reminded that much more people are killed in cars than all forms of air travel combined.  Stop leaving our houses.  It\\'s killing everyone.Finally, a confirmed truthful statement by officials being reportedTrump\\'s is also plagiarized off of Obama\\'s so that plays a part in why it feels disingenuosOof.  I\\'ve had that happen to me when I first started redditing years ago.  Really annoying. That person may do it for a week or more to boot.[deleted][removed]It’s not even that you’re wrong, it’s just that it’s so weird that Trump comes to mind when Kobe Bryant dies. I understand he tweeted about it, but it’s just not pertinent to celebrating the life of Kobe. The current + former president shouldn’t even be included in this discussion. I’m sure a million famous people tweeted something out,  but analyzing their opinions detracts from Kobe himself, along with his family. You’re putting the emphasis on a politician when it should be on the man who just passed away. Sure it’s an objective observation, but if you weren’t trying to make it political, you would’ve kept it to yourself instead of commenting it in a thread about his death. How else are people supposed to respond to this? You’re inciting a political response with the nature of your post dude. Who cares about Trump and Obama rn, it should be about mourning for Kobe.[removed]I don’t get upvotes and down votes to be honest. Can’t understand why you would be downvoted. As communicators Obama and Trump are in different universes. One can express genuine empathy the other can’t.Bro. He literally reworded Obama’s tweet haha.Because Trump is a liberal... user of exclamation points. Takes away the gravity of anything he says.Who gives a shit?Because Obama actually cares and Trump is just acknowledging it because he has to. Like you said, it’s not even political and one can argue that the observation is objective.Kinda like the people ITT. You can tell who likes basketball and has admired Kobe in one way or another, and who doesn’t care about basketball or Kobe because they don’t have any personal connection to him apart from knowing his name and that he was a good Lakers player.It’s sad how ignorant and shitty some people act just because they don’t care about it and can’t understand that other people do. Like come on man. A basketball legend and arguably overall positive influence on millions just died a horrific death. Now’s not the time to be edgy>systematically downvoting Lmao stop itYou were definitely trying to be political. Unnecessary observation. Really not the time for it.[deleted]She was trying to say Knicks, then corrected mid-way. It was unfortunate, but she did NOT say what you think she did. You probably know this, but posted it anyway for the karma. Classy.Rip her careerAnd hitler was a dog lover, ghandi didnt like black folks...turns out human beings are super complicated and arnt wholly good or evil...but do you[deleted]Wtf is wrong with you?Based on the pics, visibility looked poor.  I understand that the pilots can still fly using only their instrumentation, but I wouldn\\'t have wanted to travel in a helicopter in that fog.One was “word” that TMZ got second hand and the other is official after boots are on the ground. You can tell that the officials weren’t happy with TMZ reporting.It was a horrible crash site. May be hard to identify bodies.Maybe a mix of the cleanup of the wretches plus immediate family talking to authorities adding plus the confirmation/identification of the victimsYou have evidence of that?How is it trying to rip itself apart? They are engineered to fly safetly long distancesNow imagine anything with an ICE is a controlled explosion.The Helicopter can hold up to 14 - depending on the configuration.  2 of the 14 are pilots.Well if your gonna make a comment like that. Your grandpas gonna get kobed tooAircraft have a device called an ELT that will automatically activate in an accident that can be used to locate the accident side and can also transmit a code that can be traced to someones contact info associated with the aircraft. In this case authorities would have pick up the ELT beacon and can contact someone associated saying \"hey your ELT is going off, have yoi heard from the crew or confirm the location of the helicopter?\" Hopefully that person can provide info on passengers etc. They will also check the location of departure to see if any eyewitnesses can confirm who may or may not be on board. You can bet employees of the small private locations the S76 took off from would remember Kobe boardingAlso he had his own custom helicopter with his logo and Nike on it and stuff. Maybe it could be recognized as his that way.. (assuming that was the one that crashed)It was only 10 minutes ago that they verified that there was 9 people on board, not 5. So it\\'s not as easy as it sounds. It was likely identified as Kobe\\'s \\'copter, given the fact that he was going to his daughter\\'s practice at his Black Mamba facility in Thousand Oaks. Bodies haven\\'t even been identified or released yet. All we can infer is that it was his daughter Gigi, him, John Altobelli (TMZ confirmed), John\\'s daughter Alyssa (who was a teammate of Gigi), and now 5 other people - likely family, friends, or coaches of other people in the chopper.Probably because Kobe didn’t show up to where he was supposed to beIt was his own personal helicopter. I assume he frequently travels between his home and the academy he was en route to.His daughter Alyssa played basketball with GiGi. I’m betting she was on board too. How awful.The fuck is wrong with you?Pretty sure when this post came up the people had not yet been revealedYeah no disrespect to anyone. But 9 people died so, R.I.P to everyone involved! Some young guy that died in this crash, but is not famous, is however the world to his mother and her world is now gone now! Which is equally sad!There were 9 casualtiesHis could fit 13[deleted]I’m assuming you were born after 9/11/01At least you have empathy. That’s the most important thing at this point. Never lose that about yourself.Lol NBA isnt that popular outside US, then Kobe death is not even close to Diana\\'sEDIT: 9 people were on board R.I.P.No.  There was heavy fog.You look at his flight path and it is highly suspect that they were trying to scud run VFR instead of flying IFR.[removed][deleted]I like how you assume drone simply because it fliesWow. Thats so coolOh man I have a similar but unrelated story; My family got “dugout club” seats at dodger stadium when I was like 8 (so, 2001-ish).**Adam Sandler**, sitting pretty incognito, was like a row down and a few seats to our right. Once my sister and I saw, we didn’t stop begging our parents to let us go say hi and ask for an autograph. But we didn’t expect this, so we had nothing for him to use to autograph the souvenirs we got (my sister had gotten a baseball and I had gotten a kids baseball bat from the club shop). We kept quoting lines from his movies and singing his songs...We were young and loud and he could probably hear us, so eventually he looked over his shoulder and gave us a nod, and my dad finally agreed to let us go say “hi” but told us not to bother him. So we walked over, and my sister said “hi”, and he said “hi,” and he asked to see her baseball, and said it was “a pretty cool ball“. He had his own sharpie with him, and he offered to sign it. We were in awe, and I lifted up my baseball bat and said “please sign mine too!” And he did sign it, then smiled and kindly said “thanks for not hitting me with that.” We were star struck and nervous so we said thanks and ran back to our seats. After that, he was all we could focus on. We were so happy. A couple other people noticed and went to say hi too, and very quickly, the crowd-cam spotted him and filmed him shaking kid’s hands...He quickly got swarmed and got up to leave. But, as he was passing us, my mom said “can I get a picture with you and my kids?” And he said “sure,” and even with the commotion and small crowd following him, he stopped, and posed with us and smiled, and my mom still has that photo to this day. He got out of there so fast after that though, apologizing to people on the way and saying he had to go. He had no body-guard or anything. Was just there, in a baseball hat, chillin’, and we ruined his day. But he was so nice about it. I don’t know why he was so friendly to us, he didn’t have to be.All I could give you was a silver but it was all I could afford. Kobe passing hurt and shocked me but hearing about this story is what finally made me break. The caring manner he had was a higher tier than his skill at basketball. I haven’t lost face since I was a kid but as a 20’s something now, this made me lose it all. Thank you.I had a similar thing happen with Walter Payton years ago. In some moments some people are just genuinely kind to their fansThis is an awesome story.  It’s little things like this that mean the world to fans.  Cherish this and thanks for sharingwhat a snitch of a bodyguard, holy shit.i mean, he wasn\\'t working for the venue, so he had no obligation to do that.Awww this is a very sweet story!Fucking awesomeAwe that\\'s so fuckin sweetNow I\\'m crying... mann..I live near Kobe and would see him around town occasionally. Got to meet him once when he and I were alone in a parking lot on an off the beaten street where no crowd would mob him. Took a quick photo and shook his hand.I love just south of Houston and am a Rockets fan. Being around 10 when the Rockets won back to back championships was absolutely nuts when you look up to all those guys. My dad had a friend who used to frequent a bar in Galveston called O’Malley’s and it was a favorite spot of Rudy T’s. Since they kept a house in Galveston, Sophie and him would grab dinner and have a drink there to unwind. No one bothered him and it was a, “Hey Coach, good to see ya.”, kinda thing. That friend calls my Dad and says Rudy is coming and to bring me so I can meet him. Long story short, we talk, Dad shows him a picture of me in my little league basketball jersey, and he invites us to watch a practice at the A&M campus on the island. Long story even longer, I get to have every single Rocket from Hakeem to Clyde to Charles to freakin Zan Tabak. EVERYBODY. But the best thing was when Sir Charles, who would be known for throwing a guy out of a bar through a window, reached around a woman who cut me in line to grab my ball, take her marker, and sign it while he told her, “Remember young lady. Children always come first.”These guys remember being a kid and looking up to sports heroes because that’s what inspired them. I’m sure they see a kid they see themselves. It doesn’t surprise me when I hear an athlete being cool to a child, it makes sense. To this day if Charles throws someone through another plate glass I’ll simply say, “Probably deserved it!”.Omg he said you were his guest 😩 brb cryingright cause 9 year olds steal those passes all the time. they should have been more kind to a kid like kobe was.I was about 9 years old at a Texas Rangers game and Michael Young was about a foot away from me. I was the only person anywhere near him, and I asked him to sign a ball. This dude straight looked down and walked away from me. I know he\\'s not obligated to sign something, but for someone as young as I was, it really made an impression. It was he and I, alone, and he ignored me. Really hurt. I wish I had a story as cool and wholesome as yours.And now I’m cryingAwee what a sweet story. Thank you for sharing.He literally used his status as a Laker to help you out and save your night.That\\'s real selflessness, what a hero.A true gentleman. As a person myself I would defend you the same way he defended you. A class act and his deed and talent will never fade away.Wow what an amazing story. Thank you for sharing.This is sweet 😭This is sweet 😭Thanks for sharing your story, goes to show what a nice guy he really was & that it wasn\\'t just an act for the cameras.[removed]2020 gave us a big hug, then kicked us in the nuts. Repeatedly.Reporting now that 9 diedThey are now saying 9 bodies. :(The sheriff at the press conference just said there were eight total on the plane.Edit: Nine to include the pilot.It really feels like the end of an era...This is exactly how I feel as well. I’m not a huge basketball fan, but there are just some names that you know because they are that legendary. Kobe Bryant was one of those athletes. He just seemed invincible. Untouchable. It’s so surreal and shocking. I cannot imagine what their family must be going through, losing their father/husband and daughter/sister in the same horrific accident. My heart goes out to them and the families of every person on that helicopter. RIP.This exactly. I never got into basketball, but throughout my formative years guys like Kobe and Shaw were always a part of it no matter what. They were all my friends talked about. They were on Tv, in commercials, it feels like a part of my childhood is gone for some reason.I know!! I can\\'t believe it. I dont want to hear who it all is..Yeah. He was known for shooting a lot and people would yell KOBE! whenever they would shoot or even throw paper in the trash. It\\'s a nice tribute and even moreso now.Some people really live to be try hards smh9 people aboard -no survivors via the official news conference where they also ripped TMZ for giving info out before next of kin has been notified.Fuck You. No seriously, Fuck You.Ok no more mourning anybody who cheated on their wife.Be careful! You might cut yourself around all of that edge!You’re really woke manAnd they ripped TMZ for leaking names. CNN reported another name of a deceased, but again the sheriff’s office won’t release more until next of kin is notified so I won’t put speculations out there.What\\'s in the movie that is relevant?Why, what happens?Ok Edgelord.That\\'s what hurts so much too. He had so many irons in the fire and we were set to watch him live life outside basketball. We did, but he left so soon. We\\'re definitely better for the work ethic he put inn everything he did and the dad that was to his daughters and the husband he was to his wife.holy shit reallyWait what!?! Can you elaborate, sorry, at work.Another rumor I read was a friend/teammate and her parents as well. Though that still leaves room for how many people. Even if 2 pilots (which this helicopter uses) that is still only 7.Just watched. Horrible. I hope there weren’t more kids than the two we already know of.Lets not forget that you\\'re a piece of shitSave it for another time man.It\\'s pretty much accepted that Kobe Bryant and Mike Tyson were falsely accused.He didn’t rape her... she lied about it.:( are you ok?I hope to god it isnt his other 3 daughters and wifeDon’t forgot possible WWIII with IranWay to bring Trump into this.Election years seem to be crazy2020 want all the smoke 💨💨💨He does have a good point, must be horrible to find out your husband/dad died through tv or worse through rumours from friends at school if your his daughters.  How did TMZ find this out so quickly anyways, how did they even know he was on board?&#x200B;Also why was there magnesium?As much as I hate TMZ, government officials should shut the fuck up when it comes to criticizing free speech on the job.I am curious why there is magnesium involved in the fire. Is it something that is used in some of the helicopter components?I was working outside this morning in Woodland Hills and noticed a private helicopter flying low and fast overhead,  enough for all of us to stop briefly and take notice. Then about 30 min later saw the news. It was flying lower than we typically see them, probably because it was extra foggy today.  A very sad day for Angelinos.Who tf called TMZ with that info?  If everything was still on fire and emergency personnel who can reach the terrain hadn\\'t arrived yet...then who knew he was dead?TMZ never fails to disgust me, I blocked them from my google news feed a long time ago.The media can be real dickheads when they want that scoop. Used to work for a time as one of the shift commanders at a larger police agency. After dealing with the media following incidents involving fatalities, they are like flies on shit. Some have absolutely no class or respect for the deceased\\'s families.This actually happened to me and my mom. We found out that her father died through facebook. He lives in another country and his new family did not bother to contact my mom when he died, which was partially due to them trying to make certain valuable objects disappear so they would not be part of the heritage. Her half sister was dumb enough to post something about him and how she remembers him blablabla. That‘s how I found out. Ahen I told her she thought I was joking and could not believe it. He had already been dead for 3 days. Fucked up...Reminds me of how Buddy Holly\\'s wife found out about his death on TV and had a miscarriage. After that the authorities changed their rules to inform the next of kin before going on TV[deleted]The sheriff can complain all they want...this story was about as newsworthy as news gets.Everyone is ignoring how this was totally preventable. The pilot flew into a mountain at 161 knots in poor visibility. Bad decision after bad decision.Steve-o said, in the h3h3 podcast if I\\'m not mistaken, that he heard of Ryan Dunn\\'s death when TMZ woke him up in the middle of the night with a call asking for comments.Here is his final flight: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n72ex#23a8271ehttps://flightaware.com/live/flight/N72EX[deleted]I had family die in a light plane crash, however it hardly got any media attention because it happened at the same time as a major terror attack in France which naturally got the world’s attention, to be honest it was for the better as we barely had any unwanted attention as a result and our family could mourn in peace. The difference in the situation here is massive and I hope all of the loved ones of those who died in the helicopter have minimum unwanted attention over the next few daysMuch respect for the Sheriff’s Dept for calling them out. Imagine being Kobe’s wife and scrolling through FB and seeing “RIP Kobe 😢” “🙏🙏🙏” etc and that’s how you find out your world ends?Jesus. Aren\\'t there laws in place that prevent media outlets from announcing someone died until family is notified?Jesus fking ChristThat comment bothered me the most. I really hope his family did not find out that he died because TMZ posted it. I am also worried that there is possibly some other family members or other people of note that died on the crash. This seems so surreal to me for some reason.Where is this info from?Why comment like a fact if you dont know the facts?Fuck this speculating have some respect9 passengers total including pilotShame on you bro...Omg eat shitThis story keeps getting worse. While I feel terrible for Kobe, I feel worse for the children onboard. I can’t image how excited they were to go to a basketball tournament (or wherever they were going) for it to turn out that way. Make sure to give your loved ones a call and let them know you love them.Helicopter and yeah I heard the sameYou\\'re a piece of absolute shit. 2 fucking children died you fucking shit stain bottom of the barrel scumYou’re disgusting.[deleted]Stop defending a woman that lies about rape. People need to stop glorifying liars. Fucking disgustingI didnt know he was a rapist, got a source on that?Edit: lmao who the fuck is downvoting me and why? Im literally just asking for a source. Pathetic.Wow you must be really woke dudeFuck fuck fuckMaybe others were minors or first of kin hadn\\'t been notified yetYeah people with families who probably wouldn\\'t want to hear of their loved ones passing on the news. Also this would not be big international news if it was not someone who was famous. Are you seriously that naive/stupid?Just announced that John Altobelli has passed.https://twitter.com/SteveFryer/status/1221548375872393216It’s inappropriate to speculate who they were without the coroner officially has identifying them.They said they want to contact the families first before revealing their names.Please keep in mind they will have to confirm and contact them first.Kobe’s reps confirmed his and Gianna’s passing, I’m willing to bet they need a bit more time to sort things out with the other families.Kobe, his daughter, her basketball team mate and the team mate’s parent and pilot9 people on boardOther 8. :(Names will be released after next of kin has been notified.Kobe’s daughter also died tooNot cool manHis 13 year old daughter was onboard as well. RIP.Well they’re keeping their names private for their families so they can only speak to them as the situation goes on and becomes official. Why would the families want their names plastered all over?How the fuck do you not understand that?Have you perhaps thought that they have not released the names because they try to confirm them? Contact the families? Not make it a shit show?Kobe and Gianna’s passing was confirmed by his reps.Just because something isn’t as safe as something else ie. Helicopters are not as safe as planes doesn’t make them unsafe.It’s still a very small chance for a crash to happen. There’s no need to overreact and and question helicoptersThey both forgot to mention that he raped a 19 year old.So Obama was a little late, are you saying it’s cause he’s black or something? What the fuck dude? Why bring that into this?that exclamation mark makes it look sarcastic, dude really needs to run his tweets with his pr team firstWho gives a shit![deleted][deleted]It’s way longer than 48 minutes to get from Newport Beach to Thousand Oaks. Even w/o traffic.[deleted][deleted]Most likely this will be Pilot Error (flying VFR below minimums)It was foggy and they crashed into a hill.Looking at the path of flight, the only version of IFR they were doing was \\'I Fly Roads\\'.Not available for EU readers 😞What in the fuckFortunately for everyone on this planet, literally no one is asking you.What happened between them?Yes his daughter Gigi also perished.I would like to think they died on impact from shock/crash injuries, being burnt alive is one of the worst ways to goYou know what\\'s tasteless? Rape.At least he apologized:>First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year. Although this year has been incredibly difficult for me personally, I can only imagine the pain she has had to endure. I also want to apologize to her parents and family members, and to my family and friends and supporters, and to the citizens of Eagle, Colorado.Vultures gonna vultureVultures gonna vultureVultures gonna vulturePeople aren\\'t all good or all bad. It\\'s all who he was.I stand by what I posted. I\\'ve gotten a couple of messages filled with hate, and comments defending his actions, but at this point it doesnt even matter. Go ahead and mourn your loss. I\\'m going to say prayers for his surviving family, because the next 365 days are going to be rough for them. I know his family will have plenty of support, but at the end of the day, no-one can replace the people who are now missing from their lives, a hole has been created. If you\\'ve ever lost someone close to you that you loved so much and then they\\'re gone, you know that feeling. Spend that love for Kobe  praying for family. They will need that.Bitch was looking for a pay day. I hate this “believe every victim” bullshit. How about no... whores are crazy and incredibly money hungry. They’d ruin someone’s lives for some money. That’s all she was. A stupid fucking money hungry whore. That has people on his death still talking about that incredible lie she created. He was the victim. She deserves to go to hellWhere do we stop with the mentality of someone being acquitted but still guilty? Could\\'ve just as easily been a cash grab.Depends on what you mean by \"getting away with it\". I read up about it and seems:1. His reputation was tarnished (this is actually the only thing I remembered about him besides being famous). 2. He lost contracts with McDonalds and some other big company, and probably more similar job losses.3. It was a long legal back and forth and they ended up settling out of court.I\\'m not a Kobe fan, never even watched a whole basketball game in my life so I\\'m not saying this out of blind support for the guy. I\\'ve also had family members who\\'ve been victims on rape and abuse so I\\'m not taking that lightly either. That said, I don\\'t think the man was a monster and I believe that he did mature and became a better person as a result. Regardless of facts, this was a tragic accident where many people died, including his young daughter.Innocent till proven guilty, no?She could have held him accountable but went for the money tho.   Be mad at her.> He may have been a star athlete.There\\'s no question that he was a star athlete. Hold him accountable for allegations all you want but they don\\'t change this fact. There\\'s really no middle ground or sense to be had here. Some people will revere him for his basketball career and some will detest him for his personal life.And you don\\'t know he was a rapist anymore than his defenders know he\\'s not one, so why not just let it the fuck go and let people mourn?Except he didn\\'t do it. He was falsely accused.[deleted][removed]Hopefully he gets shot up or killed somehow soon. POS like him don\\'t deserve to live.I thought it was a joke.Lebron just passed him on the points list last night Kobe tweeted himThe fatality number in General Aviation is not that much different per hour (about 1.5 more per operating hour), it is just Helicopters are much more expensive to operate.  Therefore when they do crash, they tend to be richer people.Cars crash way moreBecause they are the fastest to go from point A to point B without having to rely on airport.Don\\'t worry we will all be reminded constantly of this. That is the black mark on his legacy and it will always come up.That said he was still a dad with kids and to many am icon so it\\'s not always black and white you know?His poor wife though.....Get out.  You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.She had her chance to testify in court and didn’tShe took the settlement money instead of prosecuting so everyone can decide for themself about that.  I feel worse for his wife, he had that “affair” with a teenager in 2003 but yet was married since 2001.  Now she has to relive it again.  He was a piece of shit either way.Shut upIt is odd how we go on and on about believe women and believing assault survivors when they come forward. But, ya know, not this one. I don\\'t get it.It\\'s sad that you feel the need to make that statement.  Just change the channel, dipshit.Thanka for letting us all know, we were all wonderingYour username says it all freak.What is the source material there?Nah I just like downvoting people that cry about downvotes.Fishing is lifeLook at you, making jokes about someone that has died. Edgy of the edgiest you are.Why do people do this and make these comments when everyone’s grief is raw 😡 have some tactJesus Christ - there\\'s a time and a place, and this is not either.what\\'s wrong with youJust fucking google it.Me too. I still shed tears for Mr. Bourdain. Kobe’s death is hitting me really hard. Born and raised in LA, Laker fan through and through; I loved what he did for the franchise but I couldn’t stomach his showboating and I was definitely in the Shaq camp, so when he got traded I blamed Kobe. Dare I say I didn’t “like” Kobe in his 20 with the franchise—- I got a lot of shit for it. And here I am now, crying my eyes out, feeling so grieved that he can’t continue doing wonderful things. I came around when he started coaching his daughter. As a women, I saw what he could and can do for women in sports, he was legitimizing it on a whole new level. Taken too soon.Kobe was a world wide star, admired  internationally. Probably also has something to with it.Look at this hollier than thou moron.Nothing will be good enough for you ppl. You will always bitch about something. Go awayBecause there’s discussions about climate change every single day, but Kobe only does one time.[deleted]It\\'s because he entertains people in a way that politicians and talking heads do not?Go fuck urselfwas it the lizard people?Even though the chick dropped the case and didn\\'t get a cent?  Because she realized it wasn\\'t rape and she was just trying to get money[removed][deleted]He was good a putting a ball through a hoop[deleted]You obviously do care of you left such a fucking sad comment like this.Lol how dumb are you that you don’t know who he isWhy are you commenting?If you don\\'t care you don\\'t care. Carry on with your life and let people who are saddened by this mournIs it hard work being a miserable twat, or does it come naturally to you?You don’t know who Kobe Bryant is?There is actually a well know procedure for landing a helicopter safely in the event of total engine failure. Helicopter pilots must be able to do it to get their license.[deleted]Helicopter travel is safer than cars by a wide margin.He didn’t like driving because it cramped him up. He said he perfected helicopters so he would be able to relaxCars are significantly more dangerous and deadly than helicopters. He wasn\\'t risking more by traveling by helicopter.Yeah he crashed on purpose clearly.  Dumb fuck2nd oldestHas that been confirmed??Right? I wish there was a system to hardware ban people from the site in extreme circumstances.According to some people on twitter who know John and his family, his wife (alyssa’s mom) Keri died as well.[deleted][removed]Um No.Helicopters perform a ton of operations besides carting around the rich and famous.This accident, though unfortunate, was entirely preventable.[deleted]It’s people pouring out a 40 of malt liquor to his memory. But instead of a 40, it’s Reddit gold and silver at $3.99 a pop. And instead of it pouring on the ground, Reddit is holding a cup underneath and catching the money and making a profit.Get the fuck out of here with this trash. She had 8 other seamen samples as well. Nothing more than a cash grab.holy shit that\\'s an amazing fuck-upDamn bro people didnt like that for some reasonIt’s not grounds for her to lose her job but it’s definitely funny as hell.LOL. That made my fucking day hearing that, thank you.Clearly just misspoke and stumbled over her words. this is a non story. Fucking outrage culture.oh my. what an idiot.[deleted]Holy shitShe clearly stumbled over the word Lakers.  Get out of here with your fake racism.   For fucks sake.Think she says “Nakers” tbh thoughHoooooly shit whoops. I wonder how often she says it in her free time for that kind of slip lol> But you know who I looked up to that whole time? The person that literally inspired me to play and who I thought of everyday I was on that court?Spud Webb?You\\'re a pathetic waste of air. Scum of the earth.Dumbass can you read, it says he died in a helicopter accidentExcuse me, you’re the idiot.Unfortunately, it\\'s just normal troll behavior.. their lives are shit and misery loves company.People keep saying that but who is celebrating? Never seen anything but supportI said the same thing after David Koch died.  Reddit did not agree.  But I seriously don\\'t know how you can celebrate the death of any man with his daughter.  It\\'s just awful.[removed]It’s amazing there’s so many people that would make negative  comments about his death. That’s an indicator of the society we live in today.This isn’t the video.  I was duped by it originally, but it’s not of this crash.This doesn’t look authentic. The scenery doesn’t matchNot realin a lot of helicopters there is only one nut holding on the rotorsPilots do not invent new ways for Helicopters to crash.It is not a forgiving beast.  Leicester city was mechanicalNTSB hasn\\'t announced Hawaiian Tour Company one but the area they were flying in is not forgiving if the pilot makes a mistake. Interesting enough - I did not see the conclusion yet for the Mexico crash by NTSBBryant crash will come out as pilot error.  THe pilot should have been flying IFR or turn around and wait out the fog.   They had get there ites ....And it’s only been 26 daysIf kobe wasn\\'t on it it would have just read \"5 dead in helicopter crash\" and people wouldn\\'t care so much.I totally forgot Kobe is an Oscar winnerthis legit made me cry. those are beautiful words.[For the uninitiated.](https://youtu.be/ziUc0OCDmoU)I grew up loving Kobe. Watching this again today made me cry like a baby.Was tearing up when I was watching it live, this now hits on a whole other level.I was lucky enough to see him narrate it live at a John Williams concert at the Hollywood Bowl, I didn’t even know he was going to be there. The absolute love and passion he had for basketball was so evident.Leicester City was MechanicalVaughn was pilot error (Flying VFR when they should IFR)Davey Allison was pilot errorColin McRae was most probably pilot error (flying to fast, too low and too inexperience).  It was not mechanicalKobe Bryant\\'s flight will most likely also be pilot error.  They were flying VFR when they should have been IFRSame here. My boyfriend is a basketball fan, always makes “Kobe” jokes when throwing things around. He came running in the room totally shocked when he heard the announcement on DAZN (German Sports streaming service). He was watching football. Now he is watching videos of Kobe’s games. I didn’t really care for it all, but hearing about the accident and that his 13 year old died too made me sad. RIP Kobe and GiGi.Except for that rape case where he basically admitted he did it...yeah decent guy hahaha[deleted]Death is part of the human experience.  Apart from birth, it\\'s the only event that\\'s guaranteed to come for every human in existence.  In a way, it doesn\\'t phase me very much because I know that when it happens, it happens.  Mourn the loss of loved ones, remember and cherish the good memories; they live on in your mind.I mean, yes, he did have 40 or so more years to live, but his 13 y/o daughter was also killed and had, like, 70 more years to live - just like the other child who was aboard. As horrible as this incident is, the most tragic part is the loss of literal children.Fog and couldn’t see the hill. Lack of situational awareness. Shouldn’t have attempted the trip.[deleted]So sorry for your loss.So sorry.I’m sorry for your loss.I hope you’re starting to feel a little better.I’m sure the woman he raped disagrees.I’d put Dale Earnhardt up there with those guys. Especially the circumstances. Maybe not quite on that level, but-Payne Stewart Marshall football Man U crashPrefontaineThurman Munson Len BiasAyrton SennaI’d put Gehrig and Payton up there too.https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfWhat does gender have to do with anything??? Women die just like men do.Did you fucking cry when my grandfather died? No? Shut the fuck up.That was random.I wasn’t aware of most of this. I agree with the OP that we can’t know 100%, but this definitely puts some things in a new light for me personally (not that it ultimately matters at all what I think)But [he was a rapist. ](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession) Buying your way out of a trial doesn’t make you innocent. He had her blood on his shirt. She had lacerations and bruises.Bryant initially told investigators that he did not have sexual intercourse with his accuser. it wasnt till they told him they had physical evidence did he fess up to having consensual sexr/angryupvoteHelicopter is only as good as its operator.In memoriamThat’s what you took from this. That’s what you took from this. Really. That’s what you took from this. You are a fucking boob.The staff don’t count as people in trump world.Ban this guy pleaseI said this down below but my late dad who had no real interest in basketball would wake up in the middle of the night to watch his games here in the EU, just because he was fascinated by his talent.And he wasn’t alone - many of my classmates did, too, when I was back in high school.That says a lot about the man’s impact on the sport and to thousands of people from the world overI\\'m not really sure how to decipher the granular data. Is ground speed the speed the helicopter was going forward? And vertical speed is the speed of ascent/descent?He had been doing it for eons. That\\'s like asking a business man why fly when you can drive everywhere.That\\'s for Rick Fox, not for Kobe.Nothing offcial yet.I dont think those details have been released/found yet. They still have to do the investigationapparently it was foggySame here. I’m 35 and looked up to Kobe like how the previous generation looked up to Jordan. Kobe has given me and my family so much happiness through out the years. When I found out we shared the same birthday I was so happy as a young kid thinking damn we were born on the same day! I know it’s dumb but that’s how much I loved Kobe. Rest in paradise to everyone that was on that helicopter. It’s such a sad day.Paul Walker as well, they are all larger than life figures and when they die in such tragic ways it\\'s absolutely devastating.This comment hit me with the biggest dejavuit\\'s been a couple hours and every new headline I see hits me with complete disbelief, like it was the first headline I read over and overGtfoh with that    No one is happy about itI’d rather not. Everwhat are they sayingYh they all deserve to die. And their daughters.Shut the fuck up!The woman admitted to lying. Can we get a banSo that was a lieThat isn’t itSome people believe the woman who accused him of rape. The evidence supported her story (his semen in her underwear, though first he repeatedly denied any contact, and vaginal injuries consistent with rape, neck injury consistent with her story he choked her, and her blood on his clothes). She gave up fighting after getting harassed and death threats by the public. Someone who forcibly raped a woman and got away with it, his death may make some people react differently than people who just see him as the basketball legend. So maybe you shouldnt be asking what’s wrong with the ones who smiled — but what’s wrong with the ones who are sad. I’m only sorry for the other people on board, especially the children.It\\'s likely not the crash.  The weather around the Calabasas area was gray and foggy at the time the helicopter went down.That’s a great story>His oldest daughter just celebrated her birthday a week ago... I can\\'t understand how she must feel right nowShe is also confirmed to be one of the victimsEDIT: His oldest daughter, Natalia, 17, is not involved in the accident. It is Gianna, 13. RIP[deleted]They are definitely NOT safer than fixed wing aircraft. That only applies to gyrocopters... if at all.What’s the coincidence?Remember innocent until proven guilty? How about you stop being a piece of trash that can\\'t keep their mouth shut when someone passes away.Remember when the case was closed because lack of evidence?Leftist? Only one type of person uses that language. UghIt\\'s funny and sad, lots of tributes and condolences about a famous person but not even a single mention for the other people, I think that\\'s so disrespectful.[deleted]Weird because I didn’t see a SINGLE comment that said thatOne of his daughters was on the helicopter tooexcept the case was thrown out because lack of evidenceClemente was a DC-7 cargo plane.Payne Stewart died in a plane crash.I\\'d spit on you if I couldThat\\'s Rick fox\\'s lawyer conforming Rick fox was not on the helicopter2016 v2that’s because you only hear about the crashesAward for whatApparently it was foggy and mountains around. Bad place to be in a helicopter. Controlled flight into terrain, it\\'s called. Happens way more than you might think.Some sources blame the tower for letting them fly in such a bad weather.Black box will be recoveredSadly, many in here haven\\'t heard it.His last play in the NBA was a full court pass to an open teammate. Fuck yourselfYou are a piece of shit.[removed][deleted]Just a horrible post manOne is confirmed by Kobe’s reps to have been his daughter, and there was obviously a pilotSo I think two are unknown stillThe five included Kobe and his daughter Gigi, one of Gigi’s teammates and their parent (names not released as of yet) and the pilot.His daughter Gina was oneSeriously, it’s like he was invincible.Rick Fox (a former Laker player) did not die, that\\'s who the attorney was mentioning.Oh man.. it\\'s just the case of terrible writing: they meant that Rick Fox was not in the helicopter with Kobe... https://www.google.com/amp/s/heavy.com/sports/2020/01/rick-fox-not-dead/amp/Rick fox isn’t dead. Kobe is. Read what you copy/pasted.I saw that too!! I\\'m really confused and hope they clarify thisEdit: it was bad wording from the writer... They are saying Rick Fox wasn\\'t in board with Kobe and didn\\'t die.Rick Fox is not dead confirmedShitty sentence structure for people who don\\'t realize that Rick fox is also a former Laker. It is referring to Rick fox not kobethere was reports that rick fox was on the plane. Rick Fox did not die. Kobe did.Rick Fox (also a former Laker) wasn\\'t on board is all this is sayingRick fox did not dieRick Fox isn’t dead.  Kobe is.[deleted]just hug her i guess. hug her hard and maybe tell her to look at your face and focus on that and nothing else?Yeah this thought is... HauntingI thought the same thing. Almost brought me to tears. As a parent myself I can’t even fathom trying to remain calm and cool so that my child doesn’t freak out, knowing that we’re both likely not going to make it. Just absolutely heartbreaking.I morbidly thought this as well. They probably had a few minutes to process what was happening. So sad.Just hug them and tell them you love them. Not much else to doWho else besides Kobe and his daughter ?Dont forget the pilots familyImagine being so consumed by sports rivalry that you make a comment like this.Imagine taking sports so seriously that you can\\'t even be respectful when someone and their daughter dies.Your precious Sacramento kings would probably be disgusted by your commentWhy does everyone bring up how much they hated him.Just be respectful ffs.What a trashy commentI saw that too. His wife is left with their 17 yr old, 3 yr old, and infant. Utterly devastating. Especially since they were on their way to a basketball practice, the eldest could’ve easily gone along with them too (luckily it seems she wasn’t).Probably because it\\'s his job and the last thing he wants to do when he relaxes is the same thing he does for work.If he was scared of flying he wouldn\\'t of chosen it as a career. And how does he go on vacation without flying? And when you say husband I\\'m assuming you mean the guy you stalk, because if he was your husband you\\'d know how stupid this comment sounds.They used really poor sentence structure. \" former Laker\" refers to Rick fox not kobeWhere are you seeing thisUpdate says Rick Fox was not in the helicopter.LPT: don\\'t speak ill of the dead. Makes you look trashy.You\\'re a fucking monster and you don\\'t deserve this but here you go and also fuck you.  His daughter diedhttps://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=1872928r/FoundTheRacistGet the hell out of here with that dumb crapYeah bro. She killed her own daughter and another kid too. DefinitelyGianna wasn\\'t the oldest.  But you\\'re point is still valid.  Rip to everyone.  Hope it was quick.Go back to your videogames, manchildI mean, Brock Turner is alive and Kobe is dead, so probably not...It doesn\\'t hold up to an ounce of scrutiny. The crash site is a wooded hill side on a foggy day. You link shows rocky barren cliffs in the sunlight.No. His heli is blue.can\\'t say anything about that footage, but a good friend of mine lives in the immediate area and told me he saw the chopper go down. it was only a bit later that he learned kobe was on board.Im cryingNo it\\'s notI think it’s not confirmedWow imagine being so fragile you can’t even read a FOX link.How would FOX be biased here? Get a lifeHe was flying to his daughters school for some practice with another parent and their kid.  That makes sense as the pilot makes the 5th person on the plane as 5 died.He was going to a practice at Mamba Academy near Thousand Oaks.No, his ghost slaps the object out of the way. Saying Kobe no longer enhances accuracy :(And, dude didn\\'t know youHe’s a dead rapistLol people were really making this a race thing? At least the rape allegations make sense but that\\'s the only relevant thing.Hey, race baiter, nobody has a problem with his skin color, they probably didn\\'t like the LakersThe helicopter yelled “KOBE” as it hit the ground[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/eud39b/kobe_explaining_the_game_to_his_daughter_last/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) is the footage you’re talking about I think.In a 2018 interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Kobe Bryant said Gianna wanted to play in the WNBA \"for sure.\" He said that fans would say \"you and V gotta have a boy ... someone to carry on the tradition.\" And Gianna would interrupt and respond, \"I got this.\" He called her the heir to his legacy. RIP Kobe and Gianna.GG s0nAnd the other 7 people. Come on now.As much as I agree with the sentiment i feel it must be said in this accident 7 other people died. In these situations its sometimes easy to forget the people who die alongside the famous. Rest in peace to all who lost their livesKobe was once asked by a reporter something along the lines of \"Don\\'t you want a son so that he can follow in your footsteps?\" and Kobe\\'s response was: \"Why do I need a son? I have a daughter to carry on my legacy when I\\'m gone.\"Right in the feels..[removed]I saw this picture and l found his daughter so lovely. It was the first time l saw her. Terribly sad.They were on their way to a basketball game where she was playing and he was coaching. This doesn’t feel real at all. Almost like in the movies when you travel to a parallel universe and find out  that some huge actor is president and everything is completely reversed. Where good is bad and up is down. I wish all of this was a dream....and the seven other people who perished.Those people are sick and don\\'t deserve to be acknowledged. It\\'s really just disrepecting everyone who passed in that crash this morning.Some people give out all kinds of different awards to “decorate” and distinguish the post. I wouldn’t put that much thought to itI\\'m so shocked.  Known as one of the greatest players.  Glad I was able to witness some of it even though I wasn\\'t a huge basketball fan.  For me, another comparable impactful loss would be Dale Earnhardt.A massively famous person died in a god damn helicopter crash, it’s a big deal. You can do the lame edgelord “hur hur why do people care so much about a guy that played a sport” thing, but it only serves to make you look like a cringe teenager. You’re here commenting, if you aren’t interested in the story just scroll past it.[deleted]He saved many lives in a different way that you may not understand.It\\'s all relative. He was the face of the NBA for years. This is sad news and it impacts a lot of people.By family you mean the woman he raped?I was not a fan of Kobe as a basketball player. He brought more to this life than just playing a sport though. His work ethic was renowned and an inspiration to young people.Edgy broProbably a mistake from habit.I saw that lmaoThat is such a bad look my god. I really don’t think she meant any disrespect but, why would that word even be crossing her mind at that moment?Dude what in the actual fuckWtf, sorry but that is definitely a fireable mistake.& this is how you get promoted to customerGoogle is your friend here. He was a retired NBA player that is regarded as one of the best.Regardless of this man\\'s past, a wife lost her husband and little girl. I have been having to face reality of losing my loved ones as they age and a few of them continuously making unhealthy choices, The thought of losing my partner, my mom, my sisters, my nephew, hell even my cat makes me feel so depressed. I get nauseous and start crying at the thought of losing any of them. To be in his family\\'s reality is too much to bear. The pain they must be experiencing is too much for me to fathom.  The fact that there are people making disgusting comments, it makes me feel sick. What the hell is wrong with people?I love aviation. I\\'ve been on a helicopter. Helicopters are scary.Even the best maintained, expertly flown helicopter in the best of weather is not without inherent risks. And life is never perfect, as demonstrated today. Foggy weather and helicopters don\\'t mix. But some people will push a pilot to do dangerous things, beyond what\\'s safe flight and not every pilot takes safety as serious.Honestly, if I had Kobe money and retired at 41? I\\'m not getting on a helicopter. Those killed too many good people in their prime for me to be comfortable on one.This really reminds me of Colin McRae; another legend who died in a helicpter crash.You must have a pretty shit life, I feel sorry for you.Uhh this is saying Rick Fox was NOT on the plane. Kobe Bryant still was.Don\\'t forget the Ukranian airlines disaster...brutal start to 2020.And how fragile life isJust paying tribute.  We really need some sort of award more appropriate for things like this, a crying smiley, or just a simple \"RIP\" logo.Accused rapist.My fingers are sore from reporting comments.Sort by live to follow the shit showI can’t even imagine what his wife and other daughters are going through. It’s tragic. I feel heartbroken for his wife and family.“I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year...  No money has been paid to this woman. She has agreed that this statement will not be used against me in the civil case... I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”Is quoting his own words an asshole thing to do?Seriously, not the time for it.its confirmedI\\'ll never understand people like yourself leaving comments like this on a thread about a world famous person suddenly passing away. They\\'re getting that coverage due to the cultural impact they had. If you don\\'t like it ignore it.The real answer. Reddit has been dumping coins in folks accounts.The other real answer, it’s their money who cares?[deleted][deleted]Ok look. I  understand you and others are upset about this but it was just a freak accident. Accidents happen and this whole situation sucks. Some mystical evil group isn’t to blame for this. Just a freak accidentYou don’t like them because they are doing their job and reporting news?Yeah... Fuck TMZ. Not like another news outlet would have reported it./sWhat a ridiculous comment lol. “I hate the news organization for reporting this tragedy”Reminds me of the time Paul walker died everyone on fb was putting rip Paul walker but not a single person mentioned the other person who died as well.   People idolize celebrities way too much.He was headed to a basketball game event with his daughter  My boyfriend\\'s daughter ( her club plays in that tournament )  told me one or 2 of the passengers were parents of kids playing in that said tournament.Why does it matter? There gonna be people you don’t know.One of the passengers was one of his daughters.Like he is more important than him.  He played a sport nothing elseThe dead are Kobe and his daughter Gigi, one of Gigi’s teammates and their parent, and the pilot.It’s so tragic. His infant daughter won’t ever have memories of her father or oldest sister.  Definitely one of the worst things I can think of. I also can’t imagine being the mom of a newborn/small infant (and all the emotional & physical/hormonal stuff that goes with that) and losing my husband and older child at once, while having to be there to help my older children process it and deal with knowing your baby will never know her dad or oldest sister. I know she has more material wealth than most (ie: she won’t have to worry about not being able to make mortgage payments & losing her home without her husband’s income, etc) but damn, that’s gotta be one of the worst things I can think of that can happen to a mother, especially when you’ve just had an infant (not that there’s a “good” time for a tragedy like this).  My heart goes out to her and her daughters.Banned in 3...2...this is a statement i can get behindGenerally speaking I think they\\'re both probably still pretty safe when in the hands of capable pilots, but I\\'m with you, no matter how much money I had I don\\'t think I\\'d ever fly anything but 1st world commercial airlines.  That said, I\\'ve only been to the LA area a few times and I can imagine it gets pretty hard to deal with freeway traffic when you have the money to just charter a jet/chopper.  SoCal is pretty fuckin miserable for the everyman.Music too.Yea you would think they would stay clear from Helicopters and Small Planes by now. I know I would.I do now and I\\'m not even famous.Which billionaire?Who’s the billionaire?Any sources to all this numbers you\\'re talking about?it being 30 yrs means little. We have B-52\\'s that are about 60 years old.You\\'re trash :)What a rude human right hereMan what the fuck is the matter with you?It’s confirmed3, unfortunately. It\\'s being reported now that one of his daughters was on board the chopper.Three...his daughter Gianna died with him in the crash 😭3 😭, one of the girls passed away also.Sadly some news outlets have no shame much like the folks celebrating Kobe’s death.The left as a whole or a majority doesn’t love Kobe. They didn’t elect him or nominate him for a political position. But you are too much of a dumbass to understand that difference.[deleted]You seem triggeredYou deserve a gold for thisMaybe life is fair after all...because no one escapes death. :(Well to be fair, being poor greatly reduces your chances of dying in a helicopter crash...For KobeOh no....this is so sad 😞Has this been confirmed cuz I keep seeing it 😭😭 it gets worseShe didn\\'t want to testify because he was rich, famous, insanely popular, and had millions of rabid fans all ready to harass her.And people wonder why victims don\\'t report abuse from powerful people. Your comment is a perfect example.when he was first confronted by police about the rape, Bryant initially told investigators that he did not have sexual intercourse with his accuser, it wasnt till cops informed him they had physical evidence that he admitted to sex but said it was consensual.https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/[removed]His daughterWas it his 13 year old daughter? Or is this another person?RIP Ayrton Senna and Kobe Bryant“This one’s for KOBE!”The fuck does Weinstein have to do with this.Ok Jim CareyI’m a huge Kobe fan but please don’t compare this to 9/11You’re a pile of trash and I hope your PS4 explodes with your favorite game in it. Sorry excuse for a humanYou’re patheticit’s magicOne of them was his 13 year old daughter :\\'/There not any indication of what caused the crash. Weather was bad here, but if witness\\' description are any indication, this was probably a malfunction.Pilot here. This has nothing to with the controller.  that decision rests solely on the pilot. A pilot can ignore any instructions a controller gives and a controller is not in control of what the pilot does. But also we have no idea what the cause of this was so let’s not go there.Not unusual to ask for and receive clearance related to low visibility.As he fucking should because who does this? Irresponsible as fuck. Helicopters are already so dangerous. I hope this isn’t true 😭What are you doing for them?Wow you sure showed everyone who dared to feel sad about kobe and gigi dyingI’m sure you’ve never felt any sadness over anyone ever then huh? You know since so many others are dying around the world. I feel sorry for you going through life so calloused.That is such a stupid point to make. Based on that “logic” then no one is able to mourn anybody because there’s always other people dying.You\\'re a fucked up dude.that’s the bigger tragedy for me. she had a whole life ahead of her, and was shaping up to be a really special player.Shut the fuck up dudeYou’re an idiot.Just remember this guy did something with his life and had people he never knew love him. And you’re just here on reddit shit posting with probably more fingers on your hand than people who care about youYou clearly put into words how this doesn\\'t affect you, and you clearly put into words how you have no understanding of respectWhat would lead you to believe it was intentionalTaking your 13 year old daughter with you when she was good at basketball and had a possible career in it seems a bit far fetchedTypical reddit fantasy story...He doesnt have a sonThat’s crazy, but he didn’t have a son...He doesnt have a sonHe does not have a sonHe doesn’t have a son.Noooooooo no no. This is heartbreaking.Fake news.Piss off.Sit down and shut up.  Fucking fake ass edge lord.Why are people saying this?

She was 13. So freaking tragicWhy?  He didn\\'t know youshut up bitchKobe inspired millionsSource? Pulling stuff out your ass like that is not good right after his deathliterally haven’t seen one post where someone says horrible shit.Its fucking insane. Like I get that not everyone likes basketball, not everyone saw him as an good person, or that “thousands of people die every day”. But to say they’re happy that a basketball legend and his 13 YEAR OLD daughter are better off dead is straight evil.Some people are triggered 24/7.

His chopper was blue and it was foggyThats definetly not hisNot the same crash, hes not even dead smhYour fucked upWhy’s that?This is Reddit\\'s fault tbhYep, down for me as wellI\\'m a Reddit liberal... but Kobe didn\\'t get convicted of shit. He\\'s clean in my eyes. RIP.[removed]Thanks man. Never looked into it (don\\'t really follow the basketball personally), but honestly sort of just assumed he was guilty due to the settlement and the way the media covered it. Glad I read this before shooting my dumbass mouth off.But I keep reading on social media that women never lie.Things will never change until we hold people making false accusations legally accountable.Thank you for thisThe dude died in a helicopter crash, taking his daughter to football practice or something. If that\\'s not a silver spoon way to die I don\\'t know what is.You can be a king or a street sweeper, but everyone dances with the grim reaperYes. It was confirmed Kobe Bryant Dead, Daughter Also Dies in Helicopter Crashhttps://amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/?__twitter_impression=trueESPN just confirmed....just started and we all know it. carpe diemyeah that\\'s herYep. Same one.Appears so. That clip is so devastating now.Think she was accidentally mixed up the names Knick’s and lakers and came out nakers..What the fuccckOkay that was bad, but holy shit that comment section is 10 levels worse somehow.Leftists are racists and have that word always on there mindNo one says that shit by accidentIt is just an accident come on...It was a flub, dudeYooooo wtf.Anyone talking shit I’d imagine is a katana polishing incel who has no idea what kind of humanitarian he was and what he did for the entire sport of basketball both men and women’sThe entire Marshall football dying in a plane crash was probably a worse day in sports.Anyones whose got something negative to say lives w/ that in their head. I wouldnt want that kind of a mindset..Theyre missing outReport any ones you see that are violent or threatening or celebrating. Mods have already said they will be promptly removed. I get it\\'s the internet and people should be able to say what they want, but not here. Don\\'t feed the trolls, let them crawl back to their sad racist subs and talk amongst themselves where nobody else can hear themWe have confirmation there was another parent and player(I’m assuming a child)They may not report names if they’re minors.They are saying one of the victims was a daughter also.[deleted]Kobe, his daughter Gianna and another parent are all I\\'ve heard confirmed. I imagine another child was onboard too. They were going to a basketball game.Some reports are saying another parent/child on their way to either a basketball game or practice.I saw reports one of his daughters was with himNo he was not:  https://twitter.com/LionBabe/status/1221536933555396612?s=20Confirmed falseHis daughter confirmed he wasn’tIt’s a warren lotas shirt. He makes a lot of those nba styled shirtstmz reported it and they were the first to report his death its most likely trueYeah ESPN confirmedYes. Its true.What a great human being you are.[deleted]Similar to Stevie Ray Vaughan. Fog, flew into the side of a hill.Not be be an auto correct bot but his oldest daughter is 17. His 2nd oldest was Gianna. I can’t imagine what his family must be going through. To have your father be one of the biggest names in NBA history, and seeing his name with “Dead” or “Passed Away” in every news source.... fucking horrible... I wish it wasn’t true. I’m not a huge NBA fan but this is such a traumatic event.So edgyUnfortunately, it\\'s RedditI’m seeing 1 daughter was in the crash, his oldest.At least one?!What...? Implying there were others besides Gina?https://youtu.be/APfPNLgHEj4[deleted]How? What did she say?As if he passed the torch...and leftYou\\'re the worst kind of personThere is a time and place for certain opinions and this isn’t it . You are a tactless moron.But did she die?[removed][removed][deleted]So heartbreaking. She was 13.Imagine being such a miserable piece of shit human being that this is how you choose to publically react to a tragedyFuck out of here. Do you think his daughter deserved to die too? What about the other people?His 13 year old daughter didn’t rape anybody. Fucked>It’s almost like raping someone brings terrible karma - who fucking knewStay classyGo back to twitter pleaseCharged but not found guilty. She never testified.Yeah sure.I’m getting intense 2016 flashbacksYou do know people die every minute in car crashes right? It\\'s much more likely you\\'d die falling down the stairs than in a plane/chopper.yes tmz said his daughter perished in the crash too.I’m so, so sorry for your loss. Sending you strength and love.I am heading to see my brother in law right now and my niece and nephews. I will update everyone once the press posts the info. Believe me or not I don’t care. I’m just in so much shock. I was supposed to meet her at the Brea Improve and her husband was supposed to perform today at 7:30.Didn\\'t the report say another player and their parent was on the helicopter? So what about your parents...EDIT: the dude was telling the truth I think. His story checks out and the husband posted on Facebook. They also just said there was 9 people on boardCondolences to your family SeanFor real??? I’m so sorry if true.Im sorry for your loss, if you don’t mind telling what did your sister do? Was she part of the helicopter crew ?So sorry ):I am so sorry.I sincerely hope you’re not shitting us right now!Don’t believe youI’m sorry to hear this manI’m so sorry. I don’t have the words to say and I am just an internet stranger, but I’m so sorry for your loss. Praying for you and everyone involved in this tragedy.[deleted]If this is true I am sorry for your loss[removed]His oldest kid is 17 not 13like him or not, Kobe was a national sports hero. He was the greatest baller of his generation. And he died tragically before his time, unexpectedly. In America sports brings ppl together, whether black, white, brown or yellow, male or female, Republican or Democrat. And it\\'s not just that Kobe was a champion, but his rigorous approach & dedication to the game inspired everyone to put in the effort to be better at your passion.The dude did much more than \"play a game\". Take a moment when something like this comes in your brain, and instead of just impulsively spouting on your bullshit, take a napThis thread is filled with people who appreciated how well Kobe played basketball. No one is claiming the world will stop spinning, but many people are understandablely upset to have lost one of the greatest players of \\'a game,\\' ever. If you have nothing to contribute to the thread except judgment of the bereaved, it\\'s probably best to not comment at all, instead of describing why you shouldn\\'t be commenting in your comment.No one will freak out. What you said is true but the difference is that this man was a household name for decades and was one of the most if not the most well known NBA players in the world. It doesn’t make his death any more or less devastating than an average person but it does mean that it effects a wider range of people.A child died too. You should probably just stop while you’re behind.Get ready for a steady stream of downvotes. Plus he was a rapist. Uh oh. I’m in trouble now.Still, I feel for his family. It sucks for them big timeDont forget he was a convicted rapist tooABC also originally said ALL of his daughters died. It is somewhat confirmed about Gigi.It has changed minute by minute.In 9 years when this child is an adult working in a call center they’re going to look back at this and cringe so hard at how pathetic they were while trying to be edgyOh fuck off you fucking cunt.What’s wrong with you?You’re scumBitch stfuYou’re a fucking idiot.RIP to the other 5 people toowtf is this comment.I’m in Malibu right now and it is pretty damn foggy, even worse this morning.[deleted]At least one of his daughters is confirmed.What said Gianna wasn’t in the crash? I can’t find it and would hope she wasn’t in it.His oldest daughter is confirmed dead per tmzCause they fly in helicopters and small planes frequently. Not 0 or 1 commercial flights a year like the average person. Not that oddIt’s literal fact he didn’t do anything beyond adultery, which is hardly deserving of death beside your daughter. Shut the fuck up with your edginess you pathetic dipshit.Get the fuck out of here with thatAnother player and parent, also the pilotI don\\'t owe them anything. I have no idea who they are. Kobe means something to me. I don\\'t understand why you\\'re so adamant that I remember someone I don\\'t know or care about simply because they died. Everyone dies.Because redditpeople do it for visibility.Tasteless sarcasm. I get people deal with grief in different ways but this is too fresh and isn\\'t a good look.not funnyThe assholes who are saying \"waaaaah he deserved to die because he allegedly raped someone\"You gotta keep up, that was last hours rumorsI think it\\'s a mistake. TMZ reporting just one daughter.I saw just one not all 4So many of us in Europe do remember those crazy games in the small hours of the night...Even my late dad, who couldn’t play basketball in his youth because he wore glasses and as such never cared too much for the sport, would wake up in the middle of the night to watch him play out of fascination.Now is not the time for anything like that.Well good thing his daughter was on board too right?Signed ones are now national treasuresNo, maybe sports history but not human historyAlso near upper merion myselfI live in LA and always wake up early, sit on my balcony, and read the news. This morning, I woke up and honestly thought, damn, it’s really, really hard to see out there today. It’s been beautiful weather but not today. The fog was thick and the air felt heavy, like it was full of moisture or going to rain soon. It was extremely dark and grey. My bf came outside and we cancelled our outdoor plans for the day, went back in and slept a few hours. When we woke up again, it was everywhere :( they are not exaggerating that it was extremely foggy out thereDevastating? Yes. One of the worst tragedies in history? Not even a blip on the radar.You\\'ve really captured the moment here.In history...?Ok this is extremely sad, but it’s not even *close* to one of the worst tragedies in history. Get a fucking grip.Eldest daughter, Gianna, was with him. 13 years old.Looking like one of them was. Gigi his 13 yr oldYour kids were wrong. Gianna was with him. :(Yes confirmed by TMZ.God damn. Extremely sad.Where did they say thisBro, not funnyProvide a source or shut the fuck up with the misinformation. Gianna is all that has been confirmed. People like you need to stop trying to be first to post an update around an event without even confirming if it’s accurate. Internet points dont matter you fucking loser.Only confirmed One daughter was on boardThis shit has always happened, every month of every year.Australia started in 2019 but yeah not a great start.Sure seems that way. Hopefully November won\\'t be like 2016...It\\'s true. Confirmed by Kobe\\'s repsWhat will you be remembered for if you ever die in a plane crash?So edgyOoooooh hey look everyone, we got a badass over hereNot really. % of car accidents are higher than helicopter accidents. Accidents just happen either way.Have you seen LA traffic?What do you mean when were young?I still doThats not his oldest daughter so you saying two of his kids died?Also thinking of the loved ones of the other 4 killed.You\\'re not living at your name sirYou fucking scumbagGirl was mentally insaneTotally not accused for money.Found the idiot.Him and his 13 year old daughter are still fucking deadYou mean the 19 year old girl that had another mans cum and pubic hair in her panties and lied to investigators?he didn\\'t rape her, they both entered a room to do sexual acts, you don\\'t enter a fucking room with another man to be friends ffs. people acting like he straight raped a broad on the streetand girl dropped the case because her story was going to be exposed.Throw a ball? You once have no clue what you\\'re talking about. Kobe was innocentHe was acquitted. Why does that not matter?Rape is a pretty strong word to use against him. He was sleeping with a girl and he did something he thought was consented. He never held her against her will or anything like that. He never even payed hush money. She dropped everything and everyone moved on with their lives. What’s there to remember?Interesting to see the conservative concern trolling here lmao I figured you guys would be celebrating that the woman lost in court and the case was thrown out. That\\'s what you usually do.[deleted]What does her being 19 have to do with it?Everywhere I’ve seen it has cited TMZ as the source. Haven’t seen any independent reporting of itJust TMZ so farPretty sure he didn’t pilot it.  Usually when you’re loaded you have a full time driver for all your vehicles.Well if it\\'s any consolation it doesn\\'t really matter how you spend your days if we all end up dead for eternity, right?No money in the world can buy you luck. We’re all passing through this earth...Are you really that fucking dumb to compare Kobe Bryant to him?What’s your point? Very different people.Man, what a reality check.I saw that tooHe had a 17 year old too[deleted]Second oldest, still very tragic 😢They can get another job. He and his daughter cant get their lives back[deleted]Link? Cant find shitNo one knows who the other 3 are, presumably one is the pilot. Kobe’s daughter GiGi was confirmed to be on the helicopterIf that bugs you so much just get on a helicopter[removed]“Don’t [allow your mind] to process failure.” -Kobe Bryant. I understand what you’re feeling but don’t sell yourself out so short. You haven’t yet given your potential an opportunity to flourish. Kobe’s attention to detail to perfect execution  and technique can be applied outside of sports and in anything you set your mind to. To paraphrase what Kobe said during his Interview with Ahmad Rashad in 2015, you must have the \"tenacity to execute with purpose and truth.”If you feel if you have no value yet, go out there, grab it, mold it, create it and execute with a true aim. Keep striving. I believe in you fellow human.He wouldn’t want you to say that shit yourself.He just played basketball, bro. He wasn\\'t a god.No one is attacking any kids or whoever else may have died. As far as I’ve seen, it’s people exclusively pointing out Kobe’s rape accusation.Rape is a joke to you ?No one said they were more important wtf?>Rick FoxNo, [https://heavy.com/sports/2020/01/rick-fox-not-dead/](https://heavy.com/sports/2020/01/rick-fox-not-dead/)Oldest daughter, yes. Confirmed by TMZ.Rick Fox, no. Denied by his daughter via Twitter.Rick fox was confirmed not there by his own daughter.They are saying his daughter as well as Rick Fox died as well but I don’t know for sureTmz said his oldest daughter Gianna was on boardhis daughter Gigi (13) is being reported being with him, sadly.His 13 yr old daughter was on it as wellBruh ask this to the 3 other people in the crashPeople fly them everyday in the military and retire after twenty years.an article stated that the helicopter kobe was manufactured in 1991. its pretty old, I\\'d imagine modern ones are much safer.I have no idea why he didn\\'t shell out to buy a new one rather than renting.Helicopters can’t fly, they’re just so goddamn ugly and loud that the ground rejects them wholesale. On a serious note, unless I’m about to die and have no other choice, you’ll never catch my fat ass climbing into a helicopter. I’d rather walk. They’re pretty close to tied with motorcycles for the most dangerous form of civilian transportation.helicopters and small planes are not safe. we used to be able to make them less un-safe but we\\'ve since lost the technology over the years of stagnation. Boeing literally employs about 200 people who just try their best to KEEP tech levels current.Based on the current info, all signs (although not confirmed) indicate that this was a pilot error and he more or less flew into the mountain due to the fog...Yeah, fuck those things. They’re death machines.The helicopters in Kauai Hawaii do on average, 500,000 flights a year, and one crashed for the first time, last year, out of like ten years.Granted this is purely anecdotal, but considering many helicopters rely on a \"Jesus nut\" to function, I\\'m not surprised they have a higher failure rate.Helicopters are pretty safe.  Pilots make poor decisions because of pressure to get the job done.  Even moreso when you have someone like  Kobe in the back.  Obviously not much has come out about the cause....but based on the weather I would bet anything this was a case of a disoriented pilot flying a perfectly good helicopter into the ground.Safe is a subjective term.  But life insurance actuaries see helicopter travel as disqualifying for most policies.  It\\'s on a list with things like skydiving and SCUBA.  You could probably get a policy but it would have an exclusion on named perils like a helicopter crash.Helicopter flying is bad weather seems to be extremely challenging, much more so than planes. This crash appears to be pilot error as well.Helicopter makers should probably start making them operate more like a drone, with the flying all done by computers and you just point it where you want it to go. It seems there is an obvious weak link when even highly trained humans don\\'t seem to be up to the task, but a $100 drone can hover around no problem.Theoretically a helicopter can be safer than a plane, as they can autorotate safely to the ground in the event of a mechanical failure. The problem is the pilots can\\'t move the stick 1000 times a second like a computer can.[removed]Seriously I’ve seen too many helicopter crashes in like every Call of Duty.https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/06/are-helicopters-safer-than-cars.html\"Based on hours alone, helicopters are 85 times more dangerous than driving. [Based on hours] helicopter flying is just 27 times more dangerous than driving.\"You do apparentlyCase was dropped...Accused of rape =/= being a rapistGo fuck yourselfDidn’t she recant her story?This is sarcasm right?I think his 13yo was on board with him :(Driving is more dangerous.On news it said someone heard \"engine sputtering\".What could that mean?13 year old daughter is confirmed to TMZ. Other two are speculationthe one about all four daughters can be safely assumed to be false given the TMZ updateJust helicopters. Leave the small planes out of it, they are just as safe as cars, if not more due to how many less small planes exists in the same space at the same time...> He sold overpriced shoes to underprivileged kids.That can be said about any athlete in promotions. They really can\\'t be blamed for it, just the morons who buy them.Wtf are you talking about, you fucking shit stain. Let the man rest in peace.Do you have proof than any of this happened?I mean... I don’t necessarily disagree with you.You need to work on your timingSource on all of this?Reddit was founded in 2005. Incident occurred in 2003. What are you talking about “Reddit was so convinced”?He was accused in 2003. Reddit was founded in 2005. What are you talking about when you say “Reddit was convinced by the DNA evidence.I still believe he is a rapist.People forget these things and surely forget the cheating he did on his wife.  But I think he tried to clear his name.  But you are holding the man accountable for his actions; I can’t fault you for thatIt’s just a coincidence.where did you see this?https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376?s=09https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/1221533868433592320?s=09A reporter said he heard something off with the engine.  I think it was described as a sputtering sound - so problem engine failure of some sort.  I\\'m sure the NTSB or some other investigative body will give us a report in due time.LA was very foggy today. Could be a factorSomeone said something about a fire in the copter. Not sure why thoughYes to him- one child confirmed.Yes, and his 13 year old daughter. Not the others.yeah wtfHis reps confirm his 13-year old was on board with him.Orang bad manCan you maybe lay off the politics for five god damn seconds? A guy is fucking dead and you have to force politics into it.It doesn’t have to always be politics, fuck.Than*  Or maybe you meant then....Why would they be pieces of shit?  For holding someone accountable for their actions even upon death?   Sure.  Sad as shit that the guy is dead.  Very unfortunate.  But we are talking about an alleged rapist and a cheater.Exactly smhDid he own the helicopter? If he didn\\'t how would he be liable?They are well taken care of.   Spending a decade in a legal battle wouldn’t hurt this family like it would an ordinary family.Um one of his kids is dead.  They were on the way to her basketball practice.4 daughters, but one was confirmed to be in the helicopter with him.Now maybe all those people claiming this isn\\'t a tragedy will shut up.https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Confirmed by his reps...You\\'re a terrible person.I can’t get that link to workLooks like he steered away from the highway.Tragic, but just noMusic did not die.And Kobe will live on in basketball forever. The word KOOOBEEE will live on forever!His daughter is confirmed by Kobe’s reps to TMZTMZ is reporting that his daughter died as well:  https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Was this before or after the rape?This should be the header for r/hydrohomies for the day.> EvianThats so awesome, I thought he\\'d order a coke or sprite as a teenager if he was afraid of ordering alcohol.I served Kobe a couple times when he was laying low during a.... trying time.... of his life. He was very quiet and very kind and left generous, but not outrageous gratuity. He’s sit alone in a booth that was a little out of site and watch sports.  Regardless of whatever went on in his personal and professional life, I have respect for people who are respectful of those in the service industry, and he did.Interesting. My sister was his Spanish class partner at Lower Merion. She always said how nice he was. He signed a piece of loose leaf paper (at her request) after he declared for the draft. Watching his growth from his time at Lower Merion to today was mind blowing. Despite a lotta hate (I’m looking at you r/nba) and the fact that he came back and destroyed the sixers in the finals...I’ve always been a staunch supporter of him and his work ethic...simply because my sister attested to his kindness. But I like to think she’s a great judge of character.  After all...she hates me.What did leo do?lol the dicaprio thing doesnt surprise me at allWhat happened with leo decap?!Why are you using this tragic moment to make up stories? Kinda embarassing dudei dont believe you based on your post history.I’m so glad you shared this. It made me smile in this tragic time. Thank you 🙏🏼wait what. go on about leoYea sure[deleted]Bru this is a cool story, thanks for sharing. Kobe always seemed like a class act. Damn man I\\'m 38 and echoing another guy in this thread, I need to get back on my life game.What’d Leo doOf course he did. He had to be at the gym at 4am to practice shooting.More stories plsHe never raped anyone. Shut the fuck up.You should bone up on the case instead of exposing your ignorance on a public forum for the whole world to see.The ones that settled?Here we go againFor the sake of comparison, he’s probably the Ronaldo of basketball. Up there in GOAT debates. In terms of character, the devotion to the training and strive to be the greatest, they’re second to none in that respect.No matter where you from and what sport you are interested, there are names you just know. Kobe, Jordan, Shaq, Beckham, Messi, Ronaldo, McRae, Senna, Lauda etc. Sad day for everyone really...Just to note, helicopters can also glide down (auto rotation).As a fellow soccer lover (whose mother is American and step father is British) thank you for this. I grew up watching Kobe AND Beckham (I’m 28) - this sentiment is great <3[deleted]Hope they\\'ll forget you too...and at least one of his daughters died as wellThose four schlubs might include is wife and/daughtersHis 13 year old daughter was on board...With a teammate and her father as wellOne of his daughters was with him, that was confirmed. There’s a rumor Rick Fox was on the helicopter too, but who knows if that’s true.just one of the kids.https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/12:35 PM PT -- Kobe\\'s daughter Gianna Maria Onore -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We\\'re told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.Just found out one of his daughters was on the copter too...I\\'m so sorry for your dad\\'s passing. Sending you wishes of peace, love, and comfort. Hope you are taking good care of yourself!/r/hmmmfuck helicoptors manBe as well as you can my friend. Happy cake and sending good thoughts your way. My mother (almost 16 years and I still can\\'t believe it) and your dad are still looking out for us - even if we can\\'t see them at this time.Likewise. And by chance, the same model helicopter as with Kobe, an S76. For my father at least it was in pitch black and the imminent crash wasn’t known. For Kobe I hope that they too did not know it was coming.Sorry for your loss.I’m sorry for your loss.Holy shit[deleted]Yeah but Kobe was not one I expected to see on that listSorry for your loss.I don\\'t think Trump supporters watch the NBA lol1 depressed, schizophrenic girl has consensual sex with him and then changes her mind halfway through. This is different to 30+ women and children saying that trump raped themNot to defend, or crucify, but >Accusation.   That doesn\\'t mean he raped someone. Or didn\\'t rape someone. Only two people could possibly know the truth of what happened between them. (Well, one person now)The Wikipedia article makes it seem like it was a consenting encounter at first and Kobe\\'s into the kind of stuff that you should probably talk about first. It also said the girl was on antipsychotics and schizophrenic.It\\'s almost like he wen\\'t to trial and was found not guilty. Can we say the same about the others?For everything he achieved and how famous he was it really is shocking how life works. Just wiped out in a crash like that. Pretty scary.I’m hearing his 13 year old daughter was with him to basketball practice. No clue who else was onboard with him. Rip to all of them.Damn, what\\'s wrong with Popeye?How about we not wish death on people[deleted]cause its kobe??? and he died??? pretty self explanatoryDont be such a goofAmazing. Thank youAbsolute chillsMan, that was hard to watch. Such an amazing player.What exactly was the point of this comment?They really just give the internet to anyone huhIt’s also been “confirmed” that Rick Fox was on board, Kobe’s dad was on board, all four daughters were on board, three daughters were on board, and it was just three friends.Let’s wait until we see reputable reports that can actually be traced to people with actual knowledge.nononono....sauce?Way to keep it classy you fuckDon\\'t use this as a chance to be ugly.The lack of social awareness in this comment is crazySome of the people in here are super disrespectful.This has gotta be one of the most out of nowhere deaths in recent memory, completely surrealso sadHe didn’t rape anyone. Shut the fuck up.Thankfully there is no god. He will be remembered and praised. You, on the other hand, will be forgotten.Oh damn. Who did he rape? Was he cheating on Vanessa with prostitutes or an affair or something?A 13 year old died along with others as well. What did Karma have against them?STFU.  It was proven he didn’t do it.  Fucking asshole.TMZ reported one of his daughters was on the plane.Its reported 2 of his daughter were onboard. 13&17.His 13 year old was with him.Tmz reporting that his 13 year old daughter is among those deadTMZ confirmed 13yp daughter killedhttps://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/It’d be weirder if it hadn’t been by this pointOr perhaps they just choose to acknowledge the game lost one of its biggest legends. Love him or hate him, there is no denying his greatness. Respect when respect is due.HoW mUcH u WaNnA bEt???Boy shut your headass the fuck up. This man was an icon that transcended sport. Let people mourn.Can you shut the fuck uphow do you post so much bullshit on reddit so consistently? almost impressiveFuck off. Should have been you, nobody would care.Hope you get off of to this... totally unnecessary..have a good life thoWe all end up dead.Just goes to show that everyone is mortal.Kobe too.Fucking neckbeard.You are missing something for sure.I cried for days and occasionally do when Dale Earnhardt died.God that\\'s so sad.It says 9 on board; is that up to date and confirmed?Sikorsky is an American company.So random. Looks to be a fan too.Coronavirus (/r/china_flu) is much worse though.Like 2016 all over again with Alan Rickman and David Bowie dying close together in January. Now we just had Terry Jones and Kobe die a few days apart.Im right.Wow that was so funny and originalthis is awful. I think what makes this entire story worse is they were prob all well aware they were going down. Helicopters don’t fly that highAnd you’ll die alone and poor.Yeah to soon. 15-20 other lakers would need to kick the bucket before that happens.Someone posted the stats of the helicopter and it seemed that as they got closer to the mountain range where the helicopter crashed, it flew up to 2000 ft and then plummeted. I’m still wondering what happened? Why pull all the way up for?As a helicopter pilot, I just have to wonder why on earth someone would fly in a helicopter for casual transport. Incredible mediceo platform, great for reaching remote sites inaccessible to planes (why they were designed)... but terrible for day to day activities. I mean, so many moving pieces..A car wouldn’t be safe either.So sad, my heart goes out to the family. He seemed like a great dad, and her a great daughter. ;(no mention of the other 7 peoples name that died in any article is pretty trashy tbhThis crash happened only about 4 miles from where I live : /....there was also other people on the helicopter....but let\\'s not mention  them at all because  they\\'re not famous..Audio from the flight:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0pQfgi9ZqU&t=137sMy fuckin heart is in my stomach. That\\'s absolutely tragic. Oh my gosh.What really gets me about this. Is they were traveling from Calabasas, to Thousand Oaks. I live in this area and it is about a 15 minute commute driving. It’s faster to drive than to fly a helicopter once you factor in loading/unloading/safety checks and all that. I’m not judging Kobe for decided to take a helicopter. How how sad it is that they died over such a frivolous thing. Not judging him. Just imagining how it would feel to know that you, your daughter, and other people are gonna die because you didn’t want to make a 15 min drive down the road.Seems like sabotage of some sort, cause they wouldn’t fly in bad conditions on purpose, and the pilot would have to be certified by lawIs Thousand Oaks fucking cursed?[deleted]That’s what happens when you think you’re invincible.Sad but Idk why they take a helicopter to a basketball practice..Just surreal man. Honestly, I am not a basketball follower but everyone knows who Kobe is.This is horrifying and sad.Words can\\'t fathom such a loss like this. She was such a smart and determined kid guided by a family driven role-model who supported women in sports and wanted nothing more then to see her succeed in her passions.She was to be his legacy.The pilot, one of Gigi\\'s teammates, and the teammate\\'s parent were also killed. Such a tragic loss of life.That\\'s a 20-30 min car ride. It\\'s just painful to think how this could have been avoided. Watching Kobe play at staples center will always be one of highlights of my life but this is just devastating.that is so terrible.  my heart goes out to their family.  I personally never cared for sports or Kobe but i can\\'t imagine the sorrow their family is going through.  no one should ever have to go through something like this.Damn....... That\\'s heartbreakingJust curious, are gyms like that generally for the wealthy?proving once again life is chaos and there is no god.How absolutely insane is it that he had to deal with a [internet death hoax](https://en.mediamass.net/people/kobe-bryant/deathhoax.html) on Friday???my god that\\'s awful, to lose not only their father/husband, but one of their sisters/daughters at the same time.Oh my god...how awful.sorry to say but tmz says his 13 year old daughter was on board. so sadTMZ is now reporting that Gianna was on board with him. I hope it’s not true.I don’t want to think what will happen leading to and in November.FUCK this year alreadyCommenting late, but there is so much unspeakable tragedy surrounding this crash. Kobe and his daughter had an amazing life ahead of them, it\\'s beyond tragic without even mentioning the other deaths involved. Things will never be the same for the ones left behind. Such a pointless and unnecessary death, it\\'s excruciating to read.Apparently TMZ were reporting it before the family had been told.......also 5 or 6 others, but they apparently  dont matter to anyone because  they weren\\'t famousI had a hard time understanding the article linked from fox.. was it 9 people 6 people or 5 people? They say all kinds of numbers.Is it just me, or does “killed” make it sound more like it was on purpose rather than accident ?Fuck tmz. They didn’t have the decency to wait until his family was informed before breaking the news.There were also 7 other people with maybe daughters and sons and friends in there. I get it one of them is famous, but I feel like these are people are made irrelevantFuck man.. heartbreakingMan they’re reporting nine potential bodies? This is so unreal.Jesus fucking Christ my heart.Also now apparently there were 9 people in the helicopter.This is just a tragedy all around. Heartbroken.So young...is she the eldest daughter? so sadMy heart breaks for Vanessa Bryant.I feel so sorry for his wife...Recently, seeing the two of them sitting courtside really became a whole mood. This is just so heartbreakingHonestly this makes it even sadder for me. I hated the Lakers growing up but seeing him and his kids celebrating after the 2009 title always made me appreciate him as a person.It’s only TMZ reporting it. Incredibly sad and I hope it’s not true.Their baby is only 7/8 months old. I’m so sad for his whole family. What a tragedy.Why do I always say that it can’t get worseThis made me really sad. I can\\'t believe it. His poor daughter. And their family. I hope they manage to cope well with such an unexpected loss.God, his poor wife. And with a newborn at home too.[deleted]Where\\'s your proof that he was a serial cheater? The only instant I know of is the one that took place in CO. Where\\'s your proof of the other instances of adultery? Also, a rapist? He was accused of rape but never convicted. I believe it was a false accusation.Piss offExcept only some redditors like you are the only ones that bring this stuff up. No one IRL will call him out ever.Go straight to hellYou\\'re disgustingI\\'ve seen conflicting reports, so maybeIt is said that neither his wife or kids were onboard.  Edit: I stand corrected.. dammn 2020 sucksReports say HIS kids were on the copter as well.What reports?Oh, man i hope not! Do you have link to Sources?That\\'s a wild leap to make. You got some exigence to back that up?Kavanaugh isnt the only accused rapist they supported for a government office tho... pretty sure theres someone else..... hmmmmmm.....Except you know..... Kobe admitted it.Wild how the people defending Kobe are the same ones that said \"believe all women\" during the Supreme court proceedings.Are they? I believe both Kavanagh and Kobe\\'s accusersWhat makes you think they\\'re the same people?How could you possibly know that?Not that wild or surprising.We’re not even a month into 2020 and it already feels like 2016 part 2.  Fuck.I don’t think that would qualify as *wishing* death on someone...riding in a helicopterWho were likely his daughters 😭Reddit has a high percentage of cynical keyboard warriors. Keep in mind that the echo chamber on this site does not represent the general public.I haven’t made aNegative comment, but I understand those that do. Rich people get away with all sorts of stuff.I feel for his family, but they will be ok.I mean, kobe died... And your here sorting by new for entertainment. It\\'s like a car crash, it\\'s hard to look away.A better way is to obsorb the news and take a little time to self reflect...  Sorting by new, finding 24/7 news coverage is the worst thing a human can do.Im here too, I\\'m guilty as well.This cannot be true... if it is, that is so heartbreaking.https://twitter.com/WPLGLocal10/status/1221531515961708544?s=20They’re saying all his daughters were in the helicopter. But nothing credible so faras i understand all 4 daughters were... has this been confirmed somewhere?edit: media in israel are saying this, let’s not assume they are the most up to dateA love letter to basketball, no less.What a legacyNot doing that.no he wasn\\'t?https://twitter.com/WPLGLocal10/status/1221531515961708544?s=20https://twitter.com/AWainwrightTV/status/1221526799542255616?s=19It sounds like maybe one or more of his daughters?  ABC backpeddled their report that all of them were on board.  Speculating is useless until we know more.You scared me there for a second. If Rick Fox was on the helicopter too I would’ve been pretty heartbroken.Rick Fox was liking tweets an hour agoSeriously, and I hope to God that isn’t true.this is a real \"thing\" these days?  I guess I am out of touch, back in my day...I think we said \"jordan\" or \"mike\"I like to think that many of the passengers think there\\'s a good chance they survive. A lot of people survive plane crashes in the movies.Pretty late to comment on this.  But, to add to it:I was aircrew in the Air Force from 2006-2010.  I accumulated 1,500+ hrs of flight time, and 800+ of it was in combat air space.  I never had a fear of flying and focusing on my job kept me from thinking about the risk of being shot down or having some kind of mechanical issues mid-flight.  That said, subconsciously I was less distracted and seemingly more focused on the “what-ifs” in flight.  I started having nightmares of being shot down, colliding with another plane, engines on fire, etc.   We had been shot at several times.  We had some rough landings but never a “crash” landing.  The nightmares got more and more vivid as time went on.  I would dream of things such as the fuselage being torn to pieces at 30,000 feet.  I could feel the turbulence and helplessness of it all.  The vibrations struck through my soul and the horrific sounds imagined in my head helped to create the most realistic of scenarios.  It started out as just once or twice a month but eventually progressed to daily nightmares.  Not after too long my sleep paralysis and sleep hallucinations started getting involved with these dreams.  If you’ve ever experienced those, imagine them being relative to dying in a plane crash and reliving it day after day.  It took a long time but it finally started to fuck me up.  I talked to a Dr and all they did was give me ambien.  It didn’t help.  All the ambien did was trap me in these nightmares longer and make them feel even more real. By the end of it I probably imagined every logical way possible to die in a plane crash in these dreams.  One time, we got shot at with some RPG’s.  The loadmaster popped the flares, the pilot took a hard turn to the left, and I just sat there going through my checklist completely unfazed.  I had already lived through that scenario and accepted the fact that if we did in fact get shot down, there was absolutely fuck-all I could do about it.  My thoughts are with the Bryant family and the families of all the others.  I hope they can find peace in this difficult time. Kobe was a legend, one of my all time favorites.  Peace!Me too :( I\\'ve been so sad the whole day about this. I\\'ve never even met the man or his daughter. RIP to all who perished. Just goes to show it can be anyone. Life is so damn precious and fragile. Can\\'t imagine all the loved ones families right now.I do this too and it haunts me. We\\'ll never really know what it was like and how scary that feeling must be. I always wonder what is going on in their minds specially those people that consciously know it\\'s gonna be their last moments.I have this weird thing where I breathe.My mum was on a flight recently crossing Indonesia which is one of, if not the most dangerous commercial route because of all the storms, turbulence and those pillars of air. They had the worst turbulence she\\'s experienced. The pilots didn\\'t think they\\'d make it so they allowed everyone to call their loved ones just in case.The only thing I remember from a near death experience was the feeling of impact, no pain at all. If I was Kobe in those last seconds with his daughter, I would\\'ve repeated these things: Close your eyes. Death is just the beginning. I will never leave you.Pretty sure that’s a common thing.Ugh me tooYeah, I imagined the plane that got shot down last month. Just flew back from the holidays too so you can imagine the atmosphere and the long flight returning back to your home. It could have happened to any of us.Looking at the accident. It was likely without warning. It looks like the pilot flew straight into the mountain. Relatively instant death.I think about this too.First confusion, then panic, then bracing for impact. Not a single good thing about it. Lots of yelling. Id imagine you would grab your daughter and try to shield her. It might only take 10 seconds to conclude that’s what you should do.That must be difficult. I try to avoid going there in my mind because it never ends well for me but sometimes it seems unavoidable.My dad died in a plane crash late 2018, I don\\'t know if it\\'s true or something people made up to calm me and my family, but the flight operators said he flew a straight line when he should\\'ve turned, they started to ask him via radio to turn and got no answers, then after two minutes of silence he plummeted straight to the ground. If that\\'s true either he had a heart attack/stroke, lost consciousness and went peacefully in his \"sleep\" or he killed himself (I hardly believe that because he was so happy, enjoying his life planning his retirement etc).(Kinda graphic sentence now) His heart and brain were pretty much crushed since the plane went straight down, so the coroner had no way to tell if he had a stroke or heart attack, but I still like thinking it went that way because imagining him awake looking at the ground rapidly approaching and suddenly being ripped into pieces is absolutely terrifying. And I did imagine this daily for the first couple of months, it\\'s brutal.You’re not the only one, I think about that tooI study plane crashes as a hobby. Usually the people are killed instantly or almost instantly.  Sometimes the plane is in trouble but the passengers are unaware until a catastrophic event happens (crash).  Occasionally it is a slowly moving event that allows enough time for the passengers to realize they are in a failing situation.  Those are the worst.I do this tooReports are that there was extreme fog with zero  visibility  and they crashed into a mountain. Good chance nobody saw it coming. I’m not sure if that makes it more or less unsettling. I’m really unsettled either way.I am near the crash site and the fog this morning was really bad, especially up against the mountains. Recent reports say they crashed directly into the mountain going 140+ knots.  If there\\'s any solace, it\\'s likely that they didn\\'t even see it coming. Visibility was about 100 feet.From the tmz article they ran into a mountain they couldn\\'t see at 161 knots. Being in the fog wouldve been stressful but i doubt they had more than a few seconds realising what was happening[deleted]I do the same. For some reason I feel like in his final seconds all he could think about was his daughter and family, not basketball. You realize you created this legacy of doing something you love, but in the end, it doesn\\'t really matter because fame and money can\\'t buy you time on Earth. If you know you\\'re going to die, all that fades away I\\'m sure. I\\'m positive he would have given all the fame and money up if he could have lived longer and spent more time with his wife and kids.Ik youre FBI and already know this, but this happens to me all the time as well. Truly heartbreaking.It strengthens my resolve to never fly unless I have to. I really hate flying.His last thoughts were probably (you know LA traffic isnt really that bad if you think about it)I\\'m glad I\\'m not the only one who has this type of intrusive thought. Seriously thought something was wrong with me.It’s one of the most helpless situations you can possibly be in that you have absolutely zero control over. I feel like nothing was said. Just everyone staring blankly in the midst of chaos and confusion while hoping that the pilot can correct it.Makes me think of the 9/11 guy Brian who called his wife to say goodbye so calmly like he just had accepted it was over. She said it helped her heal. I can’t even imagine*It always seems a bit abstract, doesn\\'t it --- other people dying.*I did this and continue to do this with 9-11. It’s morbid and it makes me feel like a terrible person and I definitely don’t do it on purpose. I think it’s partially empathetic? Idk. Part of me wants/ needs to bear some portion of the tragedy on my shoulders (which is still strange because it doesn’t help anyone). I don’t know...the human mind is a mystery.In those moments you don\\'t think. Actually what happens is that the mind collapses so no suffering is experienced.What’s sad is to think that those people on the helicopter probably had similar thoughts when they heard about other aviation accidents maybe even as recently as the Iran oneI\\'m pretty sure everyone does thisBecause it’s the one thing in today’s society that has never been recorded, you you can only really imagineCertainly not a weird thing to do. This bothers me greatly as well. He must have been so terrified for his daughter who,  at age 13, didn’t get a chance to live a fulfilling life.I am like this too which like someone said means we’re empathetic. I think it’s also because we’re anxiety ridden and I’m mortified to leave my family that way. I have a huge fear of flying and have a flight tomorrow and I feel so awfully nervous now. Weeks leading up to it I have to calm myself with statistics and logic and pretend-excitement and then something like this causes those thoughts to completely cancel any of that out.And then I realize that one of the people might have had a fear of flying like me but brushed it off and convinced themselves it would be ok too. Ugh. I know helicopters are riskier then general aviation but still. I feel so terrible for those who lost their lives and their families. It’s just a horrible way to go in my opinion.With a car or a motorcycle, accidents happen really fast. Most people can\\'t really recall how it happened exactly if they survive one, they just know that they made the wrong move one second and woke up in the hospital the next.With plane crashes, there\\'s the fall. You know that for a few minutes those people knew that there\\'s something wrong and, eventually, that they are going to die. That just makes plane crashes so much scarier.Have you ever watched the film United 93?  If not, I highly recommend it.  It\\'s a slow start, but it ends up being incredibly powerful.I can’t help but think about the fear they all probably felt. I hope they didn’t suffer in a horrific way, and if so... I hope it wasn’t long.  I can not imagine what Vanessa, his wife is going through right now.  Just completely heartbreaking.  I hope people give them the space and respect they need to grieve their way & their timeline.  Unless he played against the Bulls, I didn’t/don’t really watch Lakers game often. But I’ll definitely be watching on Tuesday as they play against The Clippers.  I got to see him play in 2005. Ronald McDonald House was gifted tickets to a game.  We were able to take the tickets. What I didn’t know , it was floor seats.  I was feet away watching Kobe play. Ad even though he played against us... you still watched him no matter what.  I’m glad he is a part of my memory of that incredible experience I had to watch the game on the court.  This is just heartbreaking.As do I. I think it’s equal parts morbid curiosity and desperation that if I should go the same way, others would consider how I felt in those last few moments. It’s devastating for all involved.I’ve gone so far as to listen to the audio clips from the black box recorders that are online. Why are we like this? :(Same with me! I wish my mind wouldn\\'t go there. Just imagining the final moments, like a movie in my head, so vivid. Different scenarios playing out,  the what ifs start to rush, loops begin to form, too many thoughts. It\\'s all too much, Warning Warning, System malfunction. Cue panic attack.Me too. I can’t stop thinking about this and him trying to comfort his daughter and knowing their lives were about to end. It’s fucking me upI actually saw a small aircraft crash by the airport in Jackson hole. Come to find out it was one of the Walmart heirs. Shook me up the day I saw it.I do this too. I think about these machines that we have created, the meticulous detail with which we maintain them, the trust we put in another human being to correctly operate them while we simply ride along. Yet all it takes is a slight malfunction of one out of billions of pieces all operating together, and it\\'s over. I don\\'t know what caused the crash, but I know everyone on board was helpless to prevent it in their final moments. Terribly sad.I was on a commercial flight years ago that lost power and cabin pressure at 30,000 feet.  We plummeted 20,000 feet before they got power back up, and then spent another 15 minutes at 10,000 feet with the most insane turbulence I’ve ever felt trying to make it to another airport for an emergency landing. During that time when everything was dark and we were just falling, I was filled with intense fear and so many other emotions. Outside of the extreme fear and anxiety I was feeling, the only other thing going through my head was how can I say goodbye to my family. I was frantically trying to turn my phone on in hopes of writing a goodbye letter in my notepad and text messages in hopes that they would at least find it in the wreckage if we crashed. It’s been over ten years now since it happened and I still get extreme anxiety anytime I’m flying and we start to descend in altitude.  The first few years flying after that I needed to take large amounts of Xanax to even get on a plane.  Every time I read about a crash like this it brings back so much anxiety........ Guess you don\\'t follow news muchAll deaths are unfortunate and sad, but the reality is that Kobe was loved by millions and people are going to express their sorrow for losing himMakes me think about thishttps://youtu.be/Pc4tfdMUWIoIt’s the fact everyone knows of Kobe. How is that surprising?Well no one knows who was on but they\\'re saying it was his kidsHm I read that he may have edited the date on his tweet? Carbon (what he tweeted from) didn’t exist in 2012Crazy tweet,But it very quickly pulled me back into the sludge of twitter. Took me like 4 clicks to be back in the trump/politics awfulness I escaped when I left Twitter a few years ago.Everyone should leave that horrible platform. It’s just constant gaslighting.That’s crazyWoah wtf..That also happenedMy parents do things separately all the time. When we were young, it was sometimes so one parent could have a break from dealing with the kids.Not saying it\\'s true but.... What\\'s wrong with that? Sometimes a parent wants to stay home while the other takes the kids for a ride anywhere.[deleted]When I was little my dad would sometimes take us out without my mom. I’m definitely not saying his girls were with him, but it’s certainly possible.It’s untrueWhere did you see it :-(Get off your high horse. Don\\'t pretend like you care about the genocides in myanmar or china. All you\\'re saying is that we should feel bad if we are sad about this guy\\'s death. You\\'re so high and mighty trying to preach to us to not feel sad over this guy who has been in our life for years.  This guy, who many of us watched since he was 16 years old, who followed his life and his stories, who watched his specials, who listened to him play the piano. That guy inspired me. I don\\'t know the other 4 people in that helicopter. I\\'ll even say, its sad they died, but I don\\'t know who they are or anything about them, and they certainly didn\\'t touch my life. But according to you I should definitely feel bad about the death of Kobe. Seriously, what\\'s the point of acting so high and mighty, so much better than all of us, to tell us to not mourn for a person who we cared about? Your point is that we should equally mourn all five people? Jesus christ man, that\\'s so misguided. If and when anyone close to you dies, I hope you mourn for my own dead father just as much as yours. Also, one more thing, while I\\'m here. This is a massive post where everyone is mourning Kobe, and that\\'s totally ok with everyone except you. You wouldn\\'t go to someone\\'s funeral just to tell people not to mourn, so on top of all of that, you\\'re the asshole. Shove it up your ass, and I hope if someone else dies in the future, you don\\'t go on some thread and tell people \\'fuck your mourning\\' like an hour after it happened. Shove it up your ass.Hundreds of thousands died today actually.  But people are sad right now and confronting mortality. And your contribution is to put negativity into the world?Generally shitty? You know this personally?5 victims .... what about pilot?  then kobe was flying?  or is it kobe, pilot, 3 daughtersBAckpedaling on those reports now...https://twitter.com/WPLGLocal10/status/1221531515961708544Not true.  It was a pilot, Kobe and 3 others*sorts by controversial*Is it about his criminal trial? I don’t even gotta sort to know to be able to know. The holier than thou crowd are some of the worst humans to existWell now I feel like I have toYeah really don’t, my sadness is mixed with hatred nowThe awards some people are giving this post are beyond sickening. That was seriously the worst idea reddit ever had.I should’ve listenedShe wouldn\\'t testify because of numerous death threats. So who knowsGee. Thanks for your first hand account.Wow, defending an accused rapist. He had enough hush money to shut her down or/ and threaten her. He is (I guess was, lol) a rapist.[TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) is stating that his 13 year old daughter perished in the crash as well. So heartbreakingThank GOD. What about the rumor that Rick Fox was on the chopper?It may be that they are waiting to notify their mom. But I pray those kids weren’t on board.You’re talking about a few exceptions and in hindsightThey were the first to report Michael Jackson\\'s death. They\\'re usually the first to break news like this everytime.Not convicted and she didn\\'t want to testify and case dropped. Not saying he didn\\'t but sure as hell not going to act as if I know because neither of us does.This is an insane thing to say. Young people die by the hundreds, probably thousand every day. Occasionally just by statistical analysis they\\'re gonna happen to be famous. Grow up.Young people have been dying since humanity began and they will continue to die. This doesn\\'t mean that something is particularly wrong with the world.Can you link a source?No source. Don’t spread unfounded rumorsWhere is the confirmation?his daughter said he was not on the helicopterSTFU racist. RIP Kobe.Has this been confirmed. A guy on ABC mentioned it but I haven’t heard anyone else.He paid his dues bruh let it go. He ascended beyond basketball and is loved by all here in cali. You dont have to be a laker fan or even a basketball fan to understand what he did for our worldBut it can\\'t be proven. I mean. Maybe it\\'s odd that he paid so much money to settle. Why do that if she is lying? There must have been something that happened. But unrepentant rapist?  Maybe he did repent as the chopper was exploding. Maybe he held his daughter and covered her eyes and yelled \"My only regret is that I can\\'t rape again!\". Who knows man. The only thing we know is he dead. My heart goes out to his wife. She lost a husband and a daughter. That\\'s gotta be rough. Seven other people died too. Those family\\'s have it rough and we should be thinking about them as well. Not talking about how Kobe Bryant liked to hot Cosby women and then pay them off.it is ok to grieve and it is ok to feel like shit about this but also the man was a rapist and willfully ignoring that says alot about the kind of person you are.Don\\'t forget to unpack the rumors that his four kids were among the victims, don\\'t do this man. Im not judging you, but reconsider this comment.No disrespect, but I don\\'t buy posts like this. It takes less keystrokes to Google his name than it does to write a post like this, and you\\'ll get a lot more information. Unless you\\'re in China or something, I don\\'t buy it.No problem, Basically he was a legendary basketball ball player who played for the Los Angeles Lakers. He set many records in his 20 year career with the team and was person many people looked up toHuge NBA (basketball) player.One of the most famous NBA player\\'s of the last 2 decades.Downvoted for being too lazy to type two words into Google.NBA legendHe wasn’t a twink,so why would you?Nobody knows yet but false and unconfirmed reports have been going around saying his daughters and Rick Fox were onboard.No news on the other people yet sadly.I saw some people on twitter saying there was a chance the other 4 were his daughters, which we can only hope and pray is not trueEdit: His 13 year old daughter was on board. Absolutely tragic for his wife and other daughters, I can’t even imagine what they are going through.One was the pilot!They just retracted this actually.Fuck I hope not!They haven’t forgotten, they just pretend it’s not true.Not the time. Not the place.Conflicting reports say all were on board and others say none so it\\'s too early to tell[removed]Dude no.... nice you fucking piece of shitkilled ≠ murdered**Killed**>cause the death of (a person, animal, or other living thing).    You aren\\'t dead\\'ed by an accident.Killed does not imply homocideIt was the helicopter all along.The word killed doesn’t imply murder, it’s fine.NBC just reporter it was his daughters onboardIt’s pretty surreal. He just congratulated Lebron last night for passing his scoring record.It\\'s confirmed nowOr honestly just no one.What the fuck is wrong with youPlease get help.What the fuck is your problem?Reread thatOnly one daughter.Really they were on the plane when the helicopter went down?That makes a lot of sense.There still a lot of conflicting stories coming out of this. Probably still wise to wait on this. Hopefully it isn\\'t true. Sad day regardless.This is false! It is not true.Am 570 sports radio said it too but haven’t mentioned it in 20 minutes so they may be walking it backEdit: that’s the LA sports radio hereBut that can’t be right what about the pilot? There were 5 confirmedI\\'ve heard the contrary[deleted]Key word being charged.  Piece of trash.that ended up being all bullshit, you\\'re a real sad sack of shit for saying this.Fuck right off mateHis 13 year old daughter also died :(Not possible. Who the fuck was flying the chopper?> this is badYes, yes it is. Please stop.Its thousands of parts all trying to go in a different directionWhere do you see this?!Impossible. Who the fuck was flying the chopper?Impossible. Who the fuck was flying the chopper?Was a helicopterNo they weren’t, only Kobe and Gianna his middle daughter but not all of themgoogle takes 3 seconds and gives you correct infoHe just had a 4th a couple months agoIncluding the baby?His daughter has confirmed that he wasn\\'t there.He wasn\\'t https://mobile.twitter.com/CourtneyFallon_/status/1221531721688068096?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5EtweetHis daughter, who is alive, confirmed he was not.This one is way more out of the blue than Michael Jackson.And does the phrase \"out of the blue\" mean out of the sky? Because that would be morbidly fitting.This time everyone young is being taken from usOnly one of his daughtersIs this true?or at least i\\'m not going to take it to go to a random sports practiseDo you get in cars? Statistically less safe than helicoptersI pray that’s not true. Their poor mother.How the fuck is that possible tho?Staying up really late to watch his last game, with my newborn, first child asleep on my lap. Something about having my first baby there with me to watch my hero play his final game. Absolutely gutted right now :(Go to hellThis may become the most downvoted Reddit post of all time.Sounds like wife & youngest daughter were not aboard; not verifiedShe apparently was not in the helicopter - haven’t seen any confirmation that the other passengers were his daughters.They’re now reporting the children were, unfortunately :/net 7 butt hurt people here...Sorry to say it is.His kids may have been with him unfortunatelyHis kids were onboardThat was posted 8 years ago and Kobe wore #8Ummmmm creepyTwitter saying rick fox was on board and daughters, also saw someone say kobe got his license to fly recentlyThey haven’t confirmed it yet, ABC (live, during the Pro Bowl) broke in to report the news and said something to the effect of “it’s not confirmed if any onboard are his kids”. That being said, although the Fire and PD might release Kobe’s name after telling his wife, they would never release the names of children. So, we gotta wait and pray this isn’t true. Tragic day, very sad. The guy had more years left than he lived.I’ve seen as many as five people being on board, but also have not been able to confirm who was in the helicopter.Report was that 4 other passengers were on board. Meaning the pilot plus 5 others. I don’t think there’s clarity who the other 4 are yet, assuming it would be his daughters or his wife & 3 daughters. Maybe the newborn was kept at homeThat\\'s what I was thinking. Really hope it isnt true.Maybe it\\'s only 3 of his daughters, sans the newborn and the pilot.What a gay commentImpossible. Who the fuck was flying the chopper?They’re death traps. And don’t let anyone convince you otherwise.So all his kids died as well?Math doesn\\'t add up unless Kobe was the pilot. I really hope this isn\\'t true.Almost war between U.S. and Iran, Volcanoe eruption in phili, Huge wildfires in Australia, and now this :(Edit: and Coronavirus too[deleted]No you did.  There I accused you, so it must be true.  Too bad you aren’t rich, I could sue you at this point and then bring it up at your funeral.Do you think this is the appropriate time for this? The guy is dead and possibly his daughters. Show some respect.One daughter confirmed, the 13 yr old.Or maybe we shouldn\\'t prescribe everything that happens due to an unimaginable number of factors simply to some omnipotent being\\'s will?This is the most vile comment I have ever heard in my entire life.He was still a human being. Being a bad person doesn\\'t mean he deserved to die like that.Too bad you weren’t on that helicopter you piece of shit.You have no proof he raped anyone you piece of shit[deleted]Confirmed already? Reports are conflicting atmHeard it slip out on ABC during the pro bowl. Hope it\\'s not true.It\\'s confirmed but we are just trying to confirm if his family was with him or not.I’d say it’s more respectful than disrespectful. It honors his time in the NBA. So yes, feel free to keep shouting Kobe as you throw stuff.It means you HAVE to nowWhy would the president say anything about......... Yeah you are rightAnd possibly 4 innocent kids? Douche bagThat’s right where my mind went too. But he still had family that loved him. It’s sad for them. But yeah, he was pretty rape-y.It was consensual, and is cheating really something that someone deserves death for?You’re part of the reason people don’t like NebraskaThat doesn’t make sense unless he was piloting. Only 5 people were in the accidentHoly fuck.Apparently ABC reported that the other passengers *were* his daughtersEdit: don’t downvote me, I’m just saying what [the report says](https://lakersdaily.com/report-kobe-bryants-4-daughters-were-also-on-board-at-time-of-helicopter-crash/)ABC is reporting his daughters were on board 😔Maybe someone will remix xxxtentacion into this?https://youtu.be/cl_WkTiH6-QThey willHe was notorious for traveling in his own private copter. Same thing as some random celebrity will die in a car crash.So he was flying it?  Because they said 5 people total, right?Is anyone confirming that??? Ugh I\\'m sick to my stomachDoes that mean its not ok to react to someones death? Are you actually gatekeeping this, holy.You\\'re a horrible human being.Just like with Micheal JacksonThe lady never testifiedABC has retracted that reportWho was the pilot if 5 people died in total?Looks like most were his family on boardYou can use the rotor as a parachute of sorts. Look up helicopter auto rotation landing.Because an autorotation is federally a very reliable way to land a helicopter in an emergency.Not to mention that helicopters fly pretty low so most of the time there wouldn\\'t be enough room to slow the fall anyway especially when you consider that you\\'re trying to make thousands of pounds of metal safely land during an emergency.Hearing it was his daughtersFuck off. Absolutely disgusting.My girlfriend just read somewhere that said it might be his daughter\\'s? Who knows if that\\'s true thoughABC is saying they were his four children.  God I hope this is incorrect please.OH GOD...I hope that’s wrong. Please god be wrong!!There’s several outlets saying different things. Some are saying that his daughters were with him, others are saying they weren’t.I heard that too. Fuck I hope not.You are ignorant if you think Kobe didnt impact the world in a positive way.Congrats on being a dick.Fuck you wish you were on the heliI mean no but not the right time rn dude[removed]To make sure it rises to the top quickly and gets exposure, I presume.What the fuck is wrong with you?Shoulda been afraid to flyIf it had been a clear day, it would have prevented the helicopter from bursting into flames?No man, let that shit live on! In fact, take 100 shots right now and say Kobe every time you make it!There are some reports all 4 daughters were with him.  I’m hoping they find otherwise.Sources are saying yes, but it\\'s not official.I haven\\'t been able to find anything substantial on this, but have been seeing people say that there are reports of this being true. Until I see official word on this, I\\'ll hope that this isn\\'t the case.E: TMZ now saying that his 13 year old daughter was one of those in the helicopter with him.   https://www.tmz.com/sports/Where are you seeing this?Impossible unless one of them was flyingWhat are you the GOAT of? You\\'re probably safe lol.I’ve read both that his kids were on board and not, I’m hoping against hip they weren’t.Reports are saying they were... Can\\'t get a good confirmation yet but omg this is fucking tragicEdit: seems like it was speculation. TMZ is reporting he is survived by his wife and 4 daughters. I hope they weren\\'t onboardEdit 2: tmz reporting his daughter Gigi was on board nowI\\'m seeing an article that says one wasMultiple reports saying his 13 year old daughter, along with a friend/teammate of the daughter and that child’s parent, were on board.no they broke into the pro bowl and the reporter said that but it hasn\\'t been confirmed and the anchor didn\\'t even react when the reporter claimed that... so bizzare. I hope the reporter just mispoke.I’m trying to find out the same thing.that isn\\'t trueThis seems to be speculation.Edit: Tmz reporting his daughter Gigi was on board nowThat’s truly terrible.I feel sick to my stomach omfg no.[removed]In what wayAnd other people on the helicopter...?Also a Philadelphia sports fan. I gasped today just as I did when I found out about Halladay. That one still hurts.Not sure how that’s possible since Kobe wasn’t flying the helicopter himselfThen who was the pilot?Thanks for your opinion, you’re definitely positively contributing to the conversation. Good job.Many people die every day, and no one cares about them it is life my dude.[deleted]ESPN just corrected their announcement. Kobe Bryant, his 14 year old daughter Gianna, the pilot, and a teammate of his daughter\\'s and her mother were on the helicopter. All are confirmed dead.Wow, why does noone write that in the headline??????Wait what? Where did you hear that? I hope for their sake it’s not trueDude, his  daughter was on this damn helicopter, show some goddamn compassion.So what about the other people on the helicopter...?His four daughters were in the crash, so not good.And his 4 daughters who were with him at the time? tell me? were they rapists?If 5 are dead, its kobe plus 4 children, then who was piloting the helicopter?There is auto-rotate.Reports are coming out his 4 fucking children were in the helicopter, are you willing to go this far?Being incinerated in a helicopter crash with your children is some Old Testament-style punishment for that.Lots of fake news going around right now, need to wait for an official reportI thought they said that on the special report on ESPN but I haven’t seen anything else about it. Hope it’s not true.Looks like that ABC report was the only one saying that right now.All I saw was his wife wasntNot really, dude had a family and they are the ones destroyed by this. Dude should have been locked up for life though.This meme is so god damn annoying. Every year has shitty stuff happen.2020 wants all the smoke 💨💨💨If his 4 daughters were aboard, how were there only 5 deaths? Was he a pilot? I hope that isn\\'t rightYou da real MVPWatch out, I’m getting downvoted In this thread for telling a dude to fuck off for calling him a rapist and saying he’s like epsteinIt was [consensual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkIy8P-TLng)!I would love you to link to anything reputable that suggests \"she was found guilty\" of anything....she was the rapist?Someone obviously doesn’t watch basketball.Dude.......the fuck? Ok.....this made me laugh but fuck dude.Holy shit.This makes no sense. Who was the pilot than? Kobe?Dawg he never raped anyone. He cheated on his wife so if you want to attack that sure but it was consensual and the girl was bragging about it.Fuck you. You\\'ll get your karmaA malfunctionAccording to ABC, all four were. Of the family, only his wife was reported not to be on board.No survivors.Apparently four?The fuck. We need to find this personABC is reporting his daughtersTake it somewhere else. Also, Chinese people hate black people a lot more than Americans.Also Ex-Laker Rick Fox they sayThat reporter had no idea what he was talking about. He made it up. 5 people on board and he has 4 daughters to 4+1 = 5. Right? Wrong.Where are they reporting that? I\\'ve checked and there\\'s no mention of that from them anywhereHe had no idea.I mean it seems crazy that he would be flying a 6 month old, but I’m middle class so I have no idea who and when people can fly in helicopters.He was in a plane not a chopper though.[deleted]That doesn\\'t mean he deserved to die or that his death isn\\'t sad.I hope you actually post this daily in order to remind people. Otherwise you\\'re a fraud.What the fuck. The only silver lining was that the kids weren\\'t in the crash. It wasn\\'t a huge silver lining, but it was there. FuckThere\\'s something wrong with you. You should take some time to figure out what that is.You are an absolutely horrible person.I don’t know much about the allegations but key word here is “alleged”Some butthurt people in this thread when they hear the truthThanks for letting us know.[deleted]The helicopter crashed over Calabasas - that’s way out of the way of the flight route between those two airports.I think that was falsekinda pissed at abc over that. Could have just been the reporter misspeaking but they just dropped that and didn\\'t even react to it.[deleted]Knew I should have gone to the gym today...This comment made me smile. Beautifully put into words. Kobe definitely is up there smiling and cheering us all on.. Rest In Peace to an absolute legend.I\\'m sorry but wasn\\'t this guy a rapist? I don\\'t get how people are honoring this guy.What up LM, Harriton in the house...mourning the loss.gentelman that was accused of raping the girl in 2003?I don\\'t care about sports at all but this has just shaken me so badly, everything about it. While it\\'s all still horrifying, this does make me feel a little better and I hope his and the other families can have some sense of peace about it going forward. What an awful way so many were lost.His daughter had her whole life ahead of her though :(Where you the one speaking on CNN today?[removed]You shouldn\\'t speak for those who no longer can.I went to LM too, and have been wearing my bootleg maroon Kobe jersey all day. I really hope Coach Downer\\'s doing alright...the press release the administration gave made it sound like he\\'s absolutely heartbroken. I was at the school when he donated $400k (to athletics and the arts program) and then gave a speech to dedicate our gym, and I still can\\'t believe how humble and inspirational he was despite all the wealth and fame. Gone way too soon.This is the one. Get this onions out here.> taking Brandy to the promHe did what now!?Thank you for sharing thisI don\\'t know. I think he would be devestated to leave his family. I can almost gaurantee that one of his dreams was to see his kids grow up.Lower Merion HS outside of Philadelphia https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/kobe-bryant-dead-helicopter-crash-fans-philadelphia-lower-merion-20200126.htmlWell now I’m crying. Thanks for this post.also went to LMHS, right before Kobe was there. Mrs Mastriano was my homeroom teacher; kobe often cited her as a positive force in his life. shocking news.My dad was an assistant coach on Lower Merion\\'s team while Kobe was there. My entire upbringing was built on Kobe story after Kobe story. Getting to watch him play in high school must have been out of this world.Terrible loss for the sport of basketball.His oldest daughter was one of the other four.I went to Ridley and I remember hearing about this dude that was just insane on the court. Then there was the story about him taking Brandy to prom and I remember thinking this dude was gonna be one of the greatest NBA players ever or flame out in his rookie year. Im not a basketball fan at all so i didnt really know he made it. A few years later I heard his name again when the Sixers were playing the Lakers in the NBA Championships. I was pleased to see that he was doing well. It was nice seeing him become one if the all time greatsI also went to Lower Merion. It is definitely hitting me extra hard. You are so lucky to have those memories.Essential reading of this thread right here. BeautifulThank you so much for sharing this.  Hugs to you my brother.I can\\'t really find an appropriate top level comment to ask this in, but you seem like you might know... Why was Shaq always so mean to Kobe?What? She still has her kids.Edit: didn’t see the report the kids were on board. Hope that’s not true.No he wasn’t, was he found guilty? No, do they have evidence? No so fuck off with that shitHow with 5 on board? Was Kobe a pilot?Not positive but some sources are saying it\\'s all of his kids☹1 would be the pilot I’m assumingConfirmed fake just now.I hope this is not true because fuck that would be even more depressingFor real??Second time I’ve seen this. Looking for confirmationDude fuck offReportedly his daughters were with him on the helicopter 😢I sure hope not. Maybe a mistake since he has 4 daughters and 4 others died? But that isn\\'t accounting for the pilot, so hopefully just a mistakeFriend said kids may have been on too.Someone has to fly the helicopter. So him and 3 other passengers.5 dead...Kobe and 4 daughters equals 5. So..who\\'s flying the chopper?No mother should have to bury their children. She\\'s apparently going to have to bury ~~all of them~~ (edit: \"only\" one), and her husband beside.I don\\'t know if not being on board is a mercy, considering that. This is the sort of thing that breaks human beings.Holy shit. Fuck.Dude at this point I\\'m begging 2020 for mercy.JESUS CHRIST. Is this confirmed?https://twitter.com/AWainwrightTV/status/1221526799542255616Yep multiple reports that his daughters were on boardRussian Psyopsugh i was hoping i heard that wrong :(Oh man please no.Why would they? That story was over long ago. He paid his dues.*accused victim *The same one that was spotted about bragging about having sex with Kobe a few days later.https://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-bragged-partygoer-happy-article-1.512242I\\'ve read the wiki, but why is everyone saying ass raped? I didn\\'t see it mentioned anywhere.It\\'s almost like people are innocent until proven guilty!I was never into basketball, so I wasn\\'t a fan of Kobe.My first question is always \"Where is the police report?\" Why does it seem like due process is thrown out the window just because a woman says she was a victim?No moronI really hope ESPN fucked that up.Could you link it if you find anything reliableABC News said the same thing. Said all 4 daughters were on board. The wife wasn\\'t. She must be really messed up right now.Heard them say the same...trying to get the real story to no avail.Really hope this is not the case.[deleted]Dude come on, you should just delete thisTrump wasn’t the rapist.I don\\'t remember the trial and convictionHe was no Kurt Cobain, that\\'s for sure.god damnMy entire D&D group just freaked out.So he was the one piloting...fuckMeh. Not impressed by silly games.I meant more like the company the pilot worked for you think it was just some guy with a helicopter? They are going to investigate the shit out of it and we might find outSorry was meant on as a response to someone else’s postNot even sure my man. I would probably say yes because I heard Kobe was also flying helicopters so he very well could have been somewhat taking notes to train, but that’s a wild guess so take that with a grain of salt.Most likely.https://youtu.be/dOee3WQGFv8I know, i am an asshole, and i know i’m going to hell.There is no public report, I just heard from someone who works with police officers. So I would take it with a grain of salt. Hopefully they were intact but it wouldn\\'t be unheard of though because the helicopter did explode from the impact. And it took them over a day to identify all victims so who knows.[deleted]And he died very young, so there could have even been more to his legacy that we will miss out on.TMZ could have some rescue units on payroll. I speculate the first to report a celebrity death, crash, bodycam footage etc. to TMZ first gets a large sum of money. The MSM i my opinion, are worse than some of the criminals in prison. They get away with more because of a lanyard that says \"journalist\". Very sadSome kid pretending to text with and call Kobe after the fact. Despicable reallyat that speed...i hate to put it like this, but the entire body is basically jello thrown up against a wall.They hit the ground almost 200 mph, it\\'s much more than the terminal speed(max velocity attainable when falling) in Earth atmosphere. Probably they felt no pain and death was sudden.Where’d you see it that he was one of the 3 bodies ?A Formula car can hit at 170mph and the driver can survive.... I don\\'t know the deceleration rate, but i\\'m sure with some creative engineering and use of exotic materials there is a way to survive such impacts.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZvBmZm6M2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZvBmZm6M2I) Or look at Kenny Brack, he survived a 214G impact. Highest amount of G\\'s that a human has survived. I gonna guess he was doing about 200mph or higher before he hit. Although he didn\\'t go to 0 immediately I guess. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\\\_2ORmCDb\\\\_sM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ORmCDb_sM) Last in 1977 before modern carbon fibre monocoque technology, David Purley had survived an 108mph to 0 impact in 26 inches into wall. 179.8G survived. (no video for this one) This is before they even had carbon fibre monocoque. Ironically, David Purley would actually die in a plane crash. (nI believe it is possible to develop something that can survive such deceleration, it will just take inginuity, creativity and no skepticism or negativity from people that think like you :)I hope at some point in human history you’re proven wrongDescending at 67 feet per second I believe (4000/60)Sorry misspoke. Didn’t do anything wrong. Edited text.says the guy thats clearly dealing death for the first time. ehhh your 12 hur dur  death hurts only people of maximum sophistication understand this.get outta here with that garbage angleHe addresses this at the end of the video. Even with the instructor helping him, it still felt \\'wrong\\' to his instincts and he struggled to override them. By then end of the video, the very trained and experienced pilot was having an anxiety attack.The pilot in Kobe\\'s crash likely hit a patch of cloud/fog he wasn\\'t expecting and quickly panicked.[removed]No I meant an actual first person view from the copter. Many modern cars have 360 cameras. Tesla has theirs too automatically activate too.  360 camera would tell us so much infoThanks for the follow up. I knew there was something out there.Is it more aerodynamic than a plane with appropriate tilt or flaps. Absolutely not, so maybe they a little more aerodynamic than I thought but a plane still has a much better chance of correcting a landing. And a helicopter sinks way faster than a plane in water landing without water flotation devices. The pilot last year who landed in water bailed and everyone on board drowned because they couldn’t get their harnesses off. Two of which were trained firefighters so... like I said I still prefer a plane. If that makes you feel better.This is absolutely incorrect, to the point that it comes off as a troll comment. Your ignorance isn\\'t the standard of the general population. Kobe Bryant was Michael Jordan levels of famous.You must have been living under a box.Get out once in a while.Kobe Bryant is ranked number 1 as the most well known player outside the U.S. he especially known in ChinaRobin Williams is good comparison. Also the death of Princess DianaYou\\'re definitely not a pilot. Helicopters can definitely clear the low LA fog we have hereAre the OPs of said posts deleting it themselves or is the comment being reported/removed from adminsHe was your generations Michael Jordan. I can not imagine if this had happened to Jordan back when we all had him at his prime. I imagine it would be this same feeling. But who knows.Apologies thought some were curious I sympathize with your statement. His death really shows how powerful we are as people.Oh shit just watched it this morning. Was surrealIs this sarcasmThat I get.  I\\'m just saying people usually up vote what they like.  This isn\\'t 200K people that liked this outcome.  It feels odd to me.  But I guess this is kinda the expected outcome when you only have 2 options of up or down.[removed]One of the greatest competitors in sports history[deleted][deleted]Well I obviously know who is is now becuse I googled him, its just BEFORE this incident I had known the name but had no idea who he was.Wow . . . that sucksOh do be awfully brief!Tell me how his daughter\\'s last few minutes of life fit into your worldview, master?[deleted]Arrogance is a helleva drugI did and doesn\\'t say much anything that  \"unknown circumstances.\"[deleted]I mean I’d assume their families might care.Talk about idolizing. He was good at throwing a ball. Yay. Sure he may have donated a lot, but then again he was a privileged millionaire who... bounced a ball. Fortunately our system has just taxation and no need for alms from those who have more money than theyll ever need..Nothing I said makes me a sociopath. Im just saying there are way, waaay more important things and people in the world, and nobody gives a shit about them at least relative to how they give a shit about some athlete. Its weird. And kinda depressing honestly.Well beside Kobe’s donations or whatever, he was a great role model. He was a leader and a positive influence to anyone that knew who he was. There are very few people who reach that level and become icons. I saw some guy being interviewed and he mentioned how sad it was because although he didn’t know Kobe personally, his family spent so much time together watching him play. Sharing moments and time to watch a single player. Now that he’s gone, those moments and that time in your life can feel like it’s gone too. This is why people mourn for celebrities and why many more will mourn such a positive person like Kobe. RIP.Of course...rest in peace to all of the other passengers as well. I hope that the two siblings that lost their mom,dad and sister can get through this somehow...I dont think anyone can imagine what its like for them. I hope they get all the help they need.Not rape. If you’re a rapist, you’re a rapist forever and you deserve to be dead.Once a person does something like this, they deserve to be shamed forever and nothing they did will make up for it. When someone does wrong, they need to be punished to make sure they never do it again. Plus rhetoric like yours tends to disrespect the victim (assuming there are any) and contributes to the rape culture.He admitted he did it and paid her off.Because the Kobe Bryant toy got helicopter blades sticking out his head and you might have heard he just died in a helicopter crash.There\\'s a difference between threatening harm on someone and feeling threatened by someone. Some people feel threatened by everything, and everyone\\'s speech ends up being censored because of that.Only because the victim refused to testify.You mean he didn\\'t serve time as a rapist. Only the people there in that purported scenario know what happened. I\\'m so sick of people assuming acquittal automatically means innocent. It spreads misinformation. If a truly innocent man were locked up for the same charge, you wouldn\\'t doubt for a second he is guilty.It never went to trial. She agreed to a dismissal of sexual assault on the expectatiom he submitted an apology.\"After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter\"There was a seperate civil suit, which was settled for $2.5 million (the most the court could award in the state at the time).Alot of comments have mentioned the other families....False, idiot.Only due to differences between volumes of passengers per year, actually.I\\'m sure I\\'m a biggest piece of shit than a rapist. Lmfao this fucking website really attracts the most braindead people.I\\'m pretty sure they settled, and he did rape that girl.He was proven innocent in the court of law. He\\'s not a rapist just because someone claims he is. Just ask Emmett Till.Are you saying that rapes shouldn’t make you angry?[deleted]Helicopter also glide, even better than planes. It’s called autorotation.Yeah.....But things change Nonstoply.Wanna keep life normal isn\\'t that easylike you said....He made them both[deleted][removed]Im sorry that you didn’t like my joke, I’m just a fan of gallows humour.Have they found out what happened? Did the helicopter hit a cliff side and caught on fire?you’re not funny manI don’t think he was better than MJ or Lebron but def top 10It was probably about him using helicopter a lot. Dont think about it that much.No. Someone tweeted in 2012 that Kobe would die in a helicopter crash.Fixed thank youLiterally all your posts are about basketball. Isn\\'t it an amazing coincidence how the defenders and enablers of celebrity rapists are always the biggest fans? Try harder trollYou’re right, my comment was largely based off of what I read off of someone’s Facebook post. I was just a bit triggered  because the man was calling Kobe toxic, amongst other things. Regardless, the man is gone, and his allegations dies with him. RIPWhat does that meanAh I see... I used to work at Bristow heliport for the oil rigs and if there was fog they\\'d go higher[removed]nice, I wasn\\'t that fortunate to have tickets. my family were immigrant, dad worked 7 days a week to keep us afloat and often come home late. we didn\\'t know jack about the rule of football, so basketball were really the only thing we can bond about and the lakers were the home team.That’s because your countries are fucking terrible at basketball. If one of the greatest soccer players of all time died tragically it wouldn’t be huge news here bc America isn’t as good or as into it. Basketball, baseball, and football are more popular here. Your viewpoint is narrow.not necessarily in Italy; I don\\'t care for basketball and knew about him by chance, because of a couple of interviews where he spoke almost perfect Italian (fans know why), and more importantly with all gentle mannerisms of an Italian person; was genuine and kind in those interviews, and things like that go a long way. I\\'m sad, hurt by the fact that he had to know her daughter would not survive him, sadder for her daughter.I dont understand why people are disgruntled that he gets more mourning than the random person; ha was in a way a distant acquaintance of manuly, it\\'s only human to be sad about something you know than someone you don\\'t know. people see a young dying father having to accompany her daughter to her end of life, and can relate. people should let people mourn.Absolutely not she\\'s put you in the mode that you now have to deal with her so you will be robotic welcome to marriageYou re lucky. Keep her safe.Ugh. Have you ever seen the bride who died in a helicopter in Brasil? It’s on youtube. This sounds awful, I don’t like what I’m about to type... but they probably were scared because the pilot was flying blind and was banking from right to left and right again (judging entirely on the maps I’ve seen online of their flight trajectory). I just think of the bride video and think it’s probably what happened to them.thanks that was an interesting post; I can understand some of the terminology from watching lots of Air Crash Investigation.Are you her? Is she your fucking sister?Of course. The paper was delivered several hours before it even happened. It\\'s just ironic.So because she isn\\'t rich enough to donate to her city her rape is fine?  Weird moral flex but ok.  RIP the victims of the crash but people shouldn\\'t pretend he was a good person just because he was a wealthy and famous person.Your grammar and use of caps are about what I would expect from someone who took that away from the story.  Whether she threw herself at him or not both claimed she asked him to stop which he refused to until she literally bled from the force of the rape.  Minimally it was sexually predatory behavior enforced physically.  Usually we just call that rape.Ugh the pilot knew and kept going? SmhSo you think he drives?I hope im wrongHere you go, friend. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-25/los-angeles-area-prepared-for-coronavirusFunny how much faith you have in the Chinese Government giving out accurate numbers and not trying to play it off like everything\\'s alright.Wonder why they\\'re quarantining something like 50 cities when there\\'s supposedly only 200 hospital beds needed.. This post isn\\'t about that tho.🤷&#x200B;Spreading through LA? Idk bout that tho lolIronically, his PR team just denied a hoax death report on Friday. That may be causing the confusion.

That\\'s really neat. Thanks for the info.I was born in Italy and came to the States when I was 13. Small world.Really surprised helicopters don’t have something like GPS that can give you a warning of upcoming terrain and let you know if you can make it safely at your altitude.I am not a pilot but if I was in a helicopter and didn’t have good visibility I would just stop and come down slowly and land it wherever and take an Uber[deleted]I am sure the woman he raped did cry after and duringKobe\\'s rape case is a part of his life, just as playing basketball is a part of his life. Keeping it in perspective is recognizing that good people can do horrible and unforgivable things and not letting one aspect of a person outweigh the others.Wow aren’t you edgy. I wish I was as cool as you are prickShut upIt just seems that it happens so much more often with helicopters than other forms of transportation. A lot of it is just due to the fact that they operated such lower altitudes, and that they seem to let you fly much more on seat of the pants than aircraft traffic that has to go between vors etc.I did a small flight in a Robinson over Los Angeles, and it was pretty shocking how we were just allowed to go essentially everywhere we wanted as long as we kept our head on a swivel and warn people that we were marginally nearby.[deleted]Why I’m not celebrating the fact this dude is dead. I just wanted to know if he did or not. Heard some other people talking bout it and wanted clarificationNo, remember gravity and falling like 1000 feet?  Cars have tires.  The tires stay on the ground, foolAnd yet I can’t help but look.Just seems weird that people feel compelled to buy random people gold when it comes to major news topics. Like I just don\\'t understand the thought of like, \"oh shit Kobe died? Fuck lemme give OP gold\".I kinda wonder that too.why the downvotes? it\\'s all true, the popo took such good notes😉🤣😂. btw, i only know of the dead guy cause i ski vail. ⛷🏂http://www.realvail.com/painful-memories-of-kobe-bryant-linger-in-vail-valley/a7488/You’re a real POS/r/foundthechevyexpress**I follow the space** r/lastimages**.*** Seeing the faces of people who have passed away before you gives you a sense of your own mortality and how easy all of these could just end.[removed]Only wealthy people die in helicopte crashes if you think about it.The crash was entirely due to the extreme fog, even the safest helicopter won’t save you when the pilot gets turned around and flies into the mountainside at 150 mph[deleted][deleted]ABC originally posted three.  That was removed and I can’t find it now.sorry. i got misinformationI didn’t even know choppers go that fast.  It was foggy so it didn’t make sense to me going that fast.9 dead in an helicopter is a very rare event ,I\\'m guessing helicopters are prepared to not explode at impact in a somewhat \"controlled\" crash.Yes but ASSUMING you are going to die if you dont jump, what are your chances? I know it\\'s 0 in an airplane, I don\\'t know if that is the case with in an helicopter.It’s unfortunate we don’t agree, and I’m certainly not going to argue with a perfect stranger, but this is, without a doubt. the most melodramatic thread I’ve ever seen on Reddit. People saying they’re genuinely heartbroken, or have been literally crying all day, or couldn’t physically or mentally handle the news of Kobe’s passing. They didn’t even know the dude. Read a comment earlier about how Kobe died too young and still had 40+ more years to live. This same comment mentioned how Kobe lost a daughter. Bro, the daughter he “lost” fucking died  today too, and she was just 13yo. I mean, come on, you have to see my point. And I understand your point, I do. People are certainly entitled to feel how they wish and should be able express that. Likewise, my opinions, even if about the opinions of others,  are as equally valid.Ah yes, Reddit... where you’re allowed to have an opinion, as long as it’s not about somebody else’s opinion.My dad used to take private helicopters all the time, and if I had to go a business meeting I would literally force him to hire me a charter bus, I don\\'t care how \"Safe\" it is, how many helicopter and Cesna crashes are there on youtube? It would take a fuck of a lot to kill me in a charter bus, but only a small mistake in any of the other two options.Like seriously, planes and helicopters kill more wealthy people than anything else transportation wise, fuck that.Yes, what do you want?Yeah. I never would have thought Kobe had soooo many close friends before reading this thread. Everybody is so understandably heartbroken beyond repair.Unfortunately many good and even accomplished people, including children, die everyday in accidents and in other ways. As far as this particular person goes he was an accomplished basketball player but not a particularly great humanitarian and was also not without controversy.  Stop worshipping celebrities.Wasn\\'t flying IFR - try again. He had over 8000 hours, was IFR certified and was a flight instructor. The pilot obviously, not Kobe. Kobe claimed to fly helicopters but he\\'s nowhere on the airmens registry so he certainly fibbed a bit there.That s-76 needs two pilots for IFR. Also no flight plan was filed and they requested SVFR at one point.  So they had one pilot and were flying VFR, basically scud running around LA and then requested SVFR and ended up flying into inadvertent IMC. Average lifespan of a pilot and aircraft flying SVFR in IIMC (tantamount to an emergency) is 15-25 seconds. Spatial disorientation followed by CFIT is what most likely occurred. All this can be found on FR24s data. Your body lies to you in situations like that, that\\'s why you\\'re supposed to use IFR and trust your instruments. They didn\\'t. This is often the result. 80% of aviation accidents are attributed to pilot error, not mechanical failure. They should\\'ve never taken off that day, end of story. Please stop talking about what you don\\'t know. Kobe was most likely in a rush especially after being held for 30 minutes over Glendale and didn\\'t want to waste time. Right before the crash, pilot contacted SoCal Approach and requested an SIS flight following but was told they couldn\\'t assist as he was way to low. He increases altitude, probably trying to climb higher and above the clouds, then you see a spike in airspeed and a rapid decrease in altitude .. and then nothing. You should probably look at the data and the pilots immaculate history before judging.100% agreeSpoken like someone whose never had a client that\\'s in a position of power.I mean, I’m theory you’re right. But tell that to the helo guy who might fear for his job if he cancels too many flights and celebs argue. It’s a real thing. I can only speak to the military side, pressure to make mission. But the idea is transferable.seriously not to be insensitive or an asshole, genuinely curious, in that kind of crash would there even be any recognizable photos that could leak? I don’t know how identifiable you’d be after that kind of impact/ fire.You\\'re right. Unfortunately, that\\'s the world we live in. Grateful to be in it regardless.I would says yes it’s important they could find what cause the crash, this is so sad 😭Not necessarily true. Only commercial and corporate charter aircraft are required to have them, private aircraft (which this was), it’s an optional thing.Seriously. I\\'m sure Kobe has done way more to help people than he has.This is why we don\\'t speak ill of the dead but some people are just broken and are incapable of any empathy.[deleted]Monty Python is too old for most kids to have a clue. You are dealing with kids who don\\'t even know who The Beatles are bro.I mean, you can apply any kind of adjective you want to condolences lol. There are no rules for this as long as it meets language guidelines, and, formally, as long as it follows structural rules and general meanings. Warmest is a superlative, so there is that. The two sentences there are basically same. Warmest wishes and warmest condolences are very similar structurally.Warmest just means loving in this sense. You all are fucking insane.Honestly, it\\'s so strange how the left overreacts to anything and everything someone does. We need to blow up our entire political structure.Jeez over reacting much? I\\'ve heard of heartfelt condolences and warm wishes but never warm condolences. If you don\\'t know the answer keep it moving.I think he’s just saying it’s not proper English. Not that I know it, but it’s probably wrong to use “warm” when talking about someone who died in a “fire”There really is no phrase here per se that anybody has to follow. You can attach a wide variety of adjectives to the word. Deepest might be more traditional, but warmest is not far off.That\\'s what I\\'ve heard too. English is not my first language so I thought I\\'d ask.Yep, and basketball was one of them.Chamberlain Heights Cartoon Predicts Kobe Bryant\\'s Helicopter Death in 2017 & PredictingTweet 2012Kobe dying in a helicopter crash. It\\'s a cartoon and a tweet from years ago saying he would die in a crash. Weird shit, but honestly more than likely a coincidence. I surely hope so dear lord.Terry was huge too. Not Kobe huge obviously. Robin was personally huge for me emotionally, but Kobe is about the biggest shock out there.I’m sure he had 0 thoughts about you big boiTrue because it never went to trial because the victim would not testify.

I just think it\\'s trashy to make fun of his death because he played for a team some people don\\'t like.I think I was misunderstood.So many people, especially on Twitter. Saying “thank god a rapist is gone” etc etc. So disgusting and sad that people can celebrate death like that. Such a sad and heartbreaking day. But days like this show the true colors of many people.***The world can be disgusting some timesYeah that part is tough though. The accuser has some big issues it seems as well, and it was really hard to tell what went on without consent. She seemed like kind of a weirdo for famous people. His behavior was horrible being married obviously no matter what you do.But in this life those aren\\'t the worst sins in the world, and the heli took a lot of people down.It was settled out of court. And there was then a civil case. And as we all know, \"settlement means guilt\".I believe it’s fairly normal to truncate the frequency that way.  I’m not a pilot, but he was requesting flight following, which means he was asking the controller to help track his position using radar.  They were also transmitting a 1200 transponder code, which I believe corresponds to operating in VFR (visual flight rules, basically the pilot can see where he is going) conditions.  That combination could suggest that visibility was marginal (again, I’m not a pilot and my flying experience is limited to ground school and a few lessons in fixed-wing a long-ass time ago).That is like 300km/h, given that jumbo planes fly at like 600-700kmh at top speed, I\\'d imagine that is close to top speed on a helicopter like [that.  How](https://that.How) stupid does a pilot have to be to fly full speed and can\\'t see anything and knows they are disoriented?  Was the pilot suicidal?That’s undoubtedly really fucking stupid. Proof: see the outcome.Right. At that speed?! Can\\'t even imagine when 60 on the freeway is already so fast. I really hope they didn\\'t feel a thing.Pilot decision.He made many poor decisions.Correct, but helicopters are up to 85% more dangerous than cars.https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/06/are-helicopters-safer-than-cars.htmlKobe knew 7 languagesI believe his dad was a professional basketball player in Italy, and Kobe grew up in Italy.He lived in Italy as a kid.[deleted]Really didn\\'t say anything offensive... It was a question, you idiotHey-o! Was honestly curious, I couldn\\'t remember what happened with thatTruth hurts, huh?Here is the track log: https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N72EX/history/20200126/1708Z/tracklogScroll down to the bottom so you can see that last few entries. At 12:44:35 PM, the rate, or feet of elevation gain per minute, increases dramatically. The pilot likely had just realized how close they were to the hillside.The next reading at 12:44:51 PM shows them trying to desperately climb higher. Their rate changes to 1,406 fpm and their altitude increases to 1,600. They continue to climb until the very end, up to 2,000 feet.When they crashed they were going 152 MPH. Slightly slower than what TMZ said apparently, but still pretty significant. Hopefully no one saw it coming and that it was instant.I am asking for more informed people to give me information that maybe isn\\'t biased or some shitty clickbait article. Somehow I knew I was gonna get downvoted for this and I don\\'t regret this post at all because it literally seems like you and others (4 replies in a minute) must be attacking anyone that brings it up?Which is wild... But makes me think that people think it\\'s rude of me to bring up that he probably raped someone I guess?If he didn\\'t correct me, but fuck all rapists. When I literally have to defend myself for saying \"maybe that rapist isn\\'t the best person.\" Fuck reddit.You people are insufferable and ignorantSo any girl who sleeps with a man can change their mind and say they got raped because they didn\\'t want to have sex. If you didn\\'t want to have sex then say something, if you don\\'t tell the other person your uncomfortable or express any disinterest how are they supposed to know without any obvious body language?Sure, a famous person might make you feel like you can\\'t say no, however if you never express that and instead just let it happen your the one to blame not them. Assuming no 3rd-party pressure is involved obviously.Nah, Kobe dying wasn’t a tragedy at all, he absolutely deserved it. The only tragedy was everyone else on the helicopter dying.Yeah, that’s a good point. Some could have survived and then died of other causes if it was a slower crash(then you are entering the realm of out of this world suffering for the survivors). The coroner’s report will probably be able to determine all that regardless. Again, just guessing, I’m not an expert by any means.[deleted]https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confessionI clearly said my message in the wrong way, if that offends anyone I’m sorry, and I wasn’t trying to sound like a dickhead, it’s just that so many people are killed in terrible ways in every day, so I was trying to lighten the mood, my bad. He raped a 19 yr old girl and majority of people don’t know that.Thank you. You have a good day.Yeah I can appreciate/understand that but it just odd for me personallyThat\\'s a horrible mentality to have friend. Praying you see the people that care and find more meaning in life.I felt thatI’ve known helicopter pilots who have described it as trying to stand and balance on top of a ball.IIRC if you\\'re high enough that the descent can rotate the blades, it\\'s not losing main rotor power in the heli that is so dangerous, because autorotation will keep the blades spinning during the descent. It\\'s not an ideal circumstance but losing engine power doesn\\'t mean it\\'s just going to plummet to the earth, and the higher up the copter is the more likely it is that it can be landed without casualties. I think a lot of times what is more dangerous is damage to the tail rotor or a lack of balance to the chopper due to something like high winds or unexpected collision with the terrain or a wire close to the ground.This probably wasn’t an engine failure. This was probably a wire strike or spatial disorientation.They were running late and thought they had cleared the mountain.I have no knowledge of flight particulars but that does sound very fast.Can anyone with aviation/helicopter piloting knowledge please chime in?Maybe the pilot was overconfident or just didn’t want to disappoint his client.It’s sad that in most cases it’s human rather than mechanical error.Totally preventable.You seem like a nice young man.[deleted]Right around that time they were circling near Glendale.Besides his daughter and the other people he was with...His daughter and 6 others died as well.

He’d be alive if he’d taken the Porsche instead. Trips me out.That’s only because hundreds of thousands more people drive cars than fly helicopters. Helicopters are objectively the most dangerous way to travel.That’s only because hundreds of thousands more people drive cars than fly helicopters. Helicopters are objectively the most dangerous way to travel.Cool, but if this particular commuter couldn’t afford a helicopter then he’d probably still be alive. His wealth killed him.Good point.\"We don\\'t know them, so we don\\'t really care about them.\"You seem nice.I mean I’m in my mid 20’s. I know the moment everyone points to is 9/11. I was on the west coast for that and was still a kid so my parents just kind of eased me in so there was no shock factor. Other shocking deaths like MJ or Prince just for some reason didn’t affect me. Closest I guess I can come to is the 2016 election, but I had already called it so I wasn’t as shocked as most other people I was with.Well this is the death of a really big celebrity since Micheal JacksonI was at a breakfast with friends and my gf texted me. I reread it 4 or 5 times.I forgotThey weren\\'t famous so it doesn\\'t matter apparently.The guy is a trashy troll, one glance at his profile screams trash.No, he just admitted that He  believed her when she said it wasn’t consensual and apologized. She forced him to choke her and leave bruises, I guessBut that’s not sexual assault. All innocent people issue statements like that before paying huge settlements.That video isn\\'t the crash from today. It doesn\\'t even look like the same location.

Surely you\\'ve experienced this while driving a car.  Nature is unpredictable.Possible.  Eye witness analysis of helicopter malfunctions are generally not reliable though.   The average person would indicate something wrong with a helicopter after seeing it crash into a hillside.  They simply would not have the technical knowledge to evaluate the mechanical distress from sound alone.[deleted]Lol imagine gatekeeping being allowed to be sad someone diedHe meant assist in basketball, but it\\'s still dumb to say today. People are seriously addicted to getting karma which means absolutely nothing.Yeah I haven\\'t seen anything about Vanessa either, just the daughter.Damn, it looks like based on the data posted above and your comment that it was most likely pilot error. The air/ground speed and altitude are all over the map, indicating the pilot didn\\'t have his bearings.Thanks, very insightfulHey, can I get your thoughts on this please?There’s unconfirmed news that the the helicopter was on fire before falling, is it possible that low maintenance of the helicopter could cause a fire? Also, do helicopters have parachutes that maybe he could’ve used? Thank you for reading my comment![Here is the data](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/)You can see the indecision at 17:38 and he begins to reduce speed (my guess would be the fog is getting worse).  At 17:40 they are still reducing speed and drifting down in alt.  At 17:42 -:43 they are  still floating down in speed and alt.  By the coordinates, am guessing they are banking to turn around sometime between 17:40-43.  During that time they dropped 100-200 feet.  Then at 17:45 they realized they  were going to hit the terrain and tried to rapidly pull up and increase speed.That’s really neat what do you plan on doing career wise as a helicopter pilot?He admitted it, publicly.No, too many rapist defenders down there.Thank you! It was 13 years ago but still effects me for sure.Ok thanks for telling me but why the downvotes?Yikes dude...Awww.  You must be great at sports from watching tv.  Got itPeople like me?  What does that mean?I’m not.  It’s sad he died. The public reaction is irrational though.  It’s the only thing on the news.I get that, however I still don’t think it’s even remotely close. That’s just my opinion though.Agreed. I don’t understand how it can be compared at all to Magic Johnson’s diagnosis, considering the man is still alive and didn’t suddenly die along with his daughter and 7 others.I was worried about that as well until I saw that video[deleted]Actually I don’t think you know much about helicopters. I have two degrees from an aerospace engineering school. If you have been in a helicopter you would know they have enormous vibration compared to a conventional aircraft. That vibration creates immense structural fatigue compared to the airplanes you are talking about. 30 years of structural fatigue is  really a lot for a helicopter. The accident may not be related to that, but what I said was that the odds were piling up. The risk of pilot error is a relative constant, although the S-76 typically has two pilots which would dramatically reduce the risk of pilot error. The risk of structural fatigue related problems grow with age even with eddy current structure analysis.Here\\'s some really good data.  If you look at the upper chart the copter was at a fairly steady 2000\\' altitude.  I don\\'t know how high the terrain is there, but one would think they knew that was a safe altitude for terrain as the pilot should have flown this route many times as the helicopter was owned by Kobe.  If you look at the end of the track it appears there was a sudden altitude gain and then a massive increase in speed.  That means either a) the helicopter suddenly gained altitude to avoid something and stalled out causing it to fall to the ground or b) the pilot lost control of the copter due to a mechanical failure possibly blade separation or a problem with the tail rotor which is almost impossible to recover from in a copter.I\\'d be a little surprised if it was A because the pilot should have known the route and since helicopters can hover quickly gaining altitude in a helicopter is not really a problem.  I\\'d be curious to know if the altitude where they hit was above or below 2000\\'.  If it is significantly below 2000\\' then it was probably mechanical failure.https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/There should have been TWO pilots, but the point is that helicopters are dangerous and when you fly on one as much as he did the odds pile up.  If risk of mechanical failure is higher, the risk of pilot error is higher (because helicopters tend to be flown in much more dangerous locations...lower altitude, nearer trees, buildings, etc.), and helicopters don\\'t really glide when they lose power often going straight down, etc. you add all that up and flying *OFTEN* on a helicopter is not a safe choice.  I\\'ve flown maybe 6-7x in helicopters.  Of those 6 or 7 different helicopters I was on, at least one of them has crashed killing all occupants. N985SAWhere are you seeing this?Yep that’s what I got—although there was some confusion about whether the helicopter avoided,  or came in contact with a power line, or that factor was an  issue at all.  They pulled the audio before I got the courage to listen to it.I seriously doubt he raped anyone, especially just off the word of some chick.Why would they use the media to notify families?[deleted][deleted][deleted][deleted]Yea thats why its called a collision and not an \"accident\". SOMEONE is at fault, whether they intended to do it or not.It wasn\\'t a \\'risky maneuver\\' in the way you think.It was most likely \\'get there ites\\'.  They didn\\'t fly IFR, the fog came in and the pilot thought they could get there on VFR.It is a tragedy, but very common...No.The pilot, most likely, just flew it into the terrain.There was fog and they were not IFR.  Looking at the data you can see they tried to pull up at the last minute.No.The data shows the pilot increase speed.  There was no problem with the engine**s**i thought he lived in thousand oaks my badIt would have been nearly a two hour drive, assuming normal traffic, and was supposed to be a 40minute Heli rideBy raping a woman and admitting to itHe admitted in a statement to having non-consensual sex with a woman, choking her, and then settled a civil complaint and paid her off.> \"Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.\"That’s Kobe’s statement. Kobe said that. He admits that she didn’t consent or think it was consensual.If I have sex with someone and think it’s consensual but they don’t think it’s consensual - well that’s pretty much the definition of rape.Either way, if I didn’t rape someone, I wouldn’t release that statement.it\\'s quite unsafeit\\'s also very unsafeYour more likely to die in a car crash driving to the game then you’re to die in a helicopter crash this is just a freak accidentWhy not, earth is burning now bud.This is not the time to mention that part of the reason for this death is that LA traffic is fucked up, also ecological and health hazard? Seems like you are shooting the messenger here buddy.Yeah you\\'re right let\\'s just keep being obsessed with celebrities.The fact you can’t empathize with OP and understand that it may be tragic for them to lose a sports icon speaks numbers about your idiotic ideologies.Because anyone else somehow has less value as a person??[removed]!RemindMe November 3rd, 2020!RemindMe November 3rd, 2020Are you saying that fraudulent, criminal, sexual assaulting reality TV show host guy is going to become President again?Easy...

Now it\\'s almost like I have no choice, and I don\\'t want to have a down thing connected to it - my mother is dying of cancer right now, I don\\'t need my dog to be another reminder of death.  Frak.I think I have to get the dog now.  But I don\\'t want to name him Kobe - the same type of dog was already named \"Kobe\" in the video I posted above I was watching, and... I don\\'t want this associated with the new puppy.I don\\'t ... know.  I don\\'t want to be reminded of Kobe Bryant dying when I think of getting a puppy.  Uhg.Yeah, who cares that he has ties to people that we pay tax money to.Exactly my point. We all want answers.Yeah, the ones we pay our tax money to.Yeah, sorry. I don\\'t mind where my tax money goes either.https://youtu.be/zPqFmyqHHqU she now freestyle raps about that day. she was a liarThere are *lots* of tourist helicopters flying around all the time. Pretty much every tourist trap area (Las Vegas / Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, etc) has several operators flying several helicopters multiple times per day. Yet in my whole life I’ve not heard of a single catastrophic tourist helicopter crash. Meanwhile, I’ve heard of like a dozen or so wealthy private helicopter crashes, and I’m sure the number of private helicopter flights every day is much fewer than the number of tourist helicopter flights.So I’d really love to know the death by helicopter rate amongst millionaires and compare it to the rate amongst the general population.Far more *people* have died by car, sure, but I wonder what the *rates* are amongst millionaires.Yes, so many crazy things have already happened in 2020.Then why did he settle paying out AND issue a very public searchable apology. 2003. That’s why you don’t remember. Too long ago. Out of the cycle.Edit: not even trying to diss the dude. Basketball wise an absolute legend. I’m just saying don’t fucking commit him to sainthood just because he died in an accident.You would have to listen to the pilot talking to the tower and find out why.  They were in Glendale.There is no video.  It was heavy fog conditionsPm me a linkThere was heavy fog.  There is no video.  It is a fakeI just don\\'t get it...why not slow down or fly higher. It\\'s foggy as fuckAnd the rest of them on board not tell him to chill? Or I wonder if they were freaking out the whole time...It just makes me angryBased on this [ATC recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0pQfgi9ZqU), pilot was flying \"special VFR\" at 1500\\'.  Ceiling was 1100\\' and 2 1/2 visibility.  Last pressure reported to the pilot was 30.16 at Van Nuys.  Not sure of the final crash altitude, or the altitude when it entered SoCal airspace.He flew VFR instead of IFR.  Not really more complicated than that.Pilots do not invent new ways to crash, unfortunately.Ok, so is Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s victim. So is Neymar\\'s victim. Don\\'t see anyone crying over them. So are millions of rape victims. Why care so religiously about an allegation that happened 17 years ago, which has already been settled and where he has apologised for? Because he\\'s dead, or you want some clout or what? Fucking neek.Ok? Well done for stating a fact and looking like a complete melt I guess. There\\'s your validation you neekMan I was obviously exaggerating with the \\'destroyed\\' thinf because thats what people who comment it effectively think they\\'re doing. And sure, don\\'t forget what happened but 17 years ago over a closed case and bringing it up when he just died is SUCH a dick move. Hes done so much good. Hate this platform sometimes, people have no common sense.Can’t deny that...So I’ve been told. I still think they’re more dangerousOops apparently I dint know anything about helicopters. That still looks like it’d be hard to perform at low altitude in a populated areaIt\\'s awful...Fuck you you piece of shit I\\'m devastated! It\\'s still so surreal thinking he\\'s dead! Your the assholeWhat, having kids means you shouldn\\'t be punished?I saw a video. After further review I do not think it is of this event.  My apologies.  I do think it was captured however.  Lots of cameras in that area.Yeah. In watching it again. The hillsides do not match.  Thank you for the scrutiny.If it\\'s the same video I\\'ve seen, it\\'s a different crash.  The one in video looked like steep cliffs with no vegetation.  Where Kobe\\'s was on a hill with brush.It’s apparently not the same crash. Someone cropped the video to hide other details that would make it obvious it’s not the same crash. What people do for views...[removed]100% agreeI actually just saw a picture of the crash site and it’s pretty flat there too.  I was just reiterating what “some expert on Twitter” was saying... but now that I hear this and finally see some actual pictures of the crash site I don’t think any of what I said anove was right.  Jeez.  Anyway.  Here we are.  Poor family :/I guess that makes sensePlease don’t speculate until it’s official. I also heard reports from —-that it’s —-   Remember ABC news -live-said all 4 of his daughters were killed.And 4 others, 9 souls on board per a press conference just now.I wonder what their names were though.It’s not like that at all though. Helicopters are objectively a higher risk form of transportation. The only reason more people die in car accidents is because there are hundreds of thousands times more people driving cars. If everyone was flying helicopters the death rate would be astronomical. In a helicopter one mechanical failure and you drop to the ground and die. End of story.I actually refuse to believe that you are that dense though, you know?Like I don\\'t know you as a person, but I really don\\'t think you are so stupid that you think that is what I meant . lol I have faith in you.Yes but there’s hundreds of thousands of times more people driving cars than flying in helicopters. Given the few amount of people who use helicopters but how many die in them it’s safe to say it’s a pretty risky activity. Not enough to diss people who use them and die in them but you should know the risk you’re taking and that it’s quite high.lol what a shitty reply! haha Your sarcasm and obvious state of being a bad person aside, I am sure you understand what I meant! :)Saying one mode of transportation isn\\'t safe isn\\'t saying everyone should stay inside haha but you know that.Go harass someone elseWho’s bitching? I was making an observation. At no point did I “hurrdurr Trump bad, Obama good”I simply stated that one reads much more empathetically than the other.Did you read the article? There’s literally a tweet from both *in the article linked*Ffs people read the goddamn articles that get posted *BEFORE* hitting the comments.Imagine being so sad you have to harass people online to feel good about yourself.The way a 14 year old would paraphrase a research paper written by a student from an accredited institute, sure.You obviously give a shit enough to replyNo, Trump does not have to acknowledge the event.Re read the tweets. Trump just changed some wording from Obama’s tweet.At this point I\\'m just gonna blanket block any and everyone who\\'s replying. I\\'m fucking done.APPARENTLY reddit knows what I was thinking better than I do.buncha fuckin\\' dispshits.[removed]Reality has a liberal biasI’m not sure if this is sarcasm or not; however with that said I don’t really have strong opinions about either man. One is a career politician, the other is a businessman. Could very well be that I have some unconscious bias but that was just the way it came across while I was reading through the article.They got no karma out of it. Now what?Folks forgive those who entertain. Michael Jackson molested kids, but he makes great music. Folks would rather pretend these \\'indiscretions\\' didn\\'t happen than to admit they like music of a pedophile. Or in this case a tall guy who can put a ball in a hoop real good, who rapes.[deleted]Still, wasn’t wrong.What was itthank you for the information! along with everyone else’s. i had no idea ELT’s were a thing but for accidents like these those seem especially handy at identifying passengers.yeah you’re right, i didn’t think about thatI’m assuming that as well.   Such a damn shame.They probably spend hours a day fantasizing and thinking about Hillary.The S-76B can fit 14 (that includes the 2 pilots)It all depends on the type of VIP configuration.I\\'m 31. This athlete was one of my favorite competitors I witnessed growing up. His drive and desire to achieve goals was inspirational to watch throughout my lifetime. I can say I only saw him in the prime. He always got better. He appeared to be dominating life after professional basketball. The entire incident that happened was sudden and tragic. In another 30 years I guarantee you I\\'ll be able to tell you exactly where I was when I heard both the news of 9/11 and Kobe\\'s incident. Just because you lack the ability to understand how this can be tragic for many doesn\\'t take away from this or any other tragedies.Don\\'t be that guy. I said it\\'s one ofIt\\'s not as popular but you know who he was and I bet everyone you know, knew who he was. Anyone growing up when he was still in the sport knew who he was.No - I highly doubt it was mechanical.It [looks](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/) like they were scud running.  There were reports of fog and the helicopter didn\\'t file IFR.  Heli-Expo starts tomorrow in Anaheim.  The experts are already on their way out for that.Wasn\\'t supermanCan you explain more? I always find it interesting hearing this sort of thing. Like why was an Uber rich celebrity hanging out alone in an off the beaten street lot? He seemed way to time efficient for that lolGo awayr/nothingeverhappensVery true. I don’t even nuts and mine were kicked!They said 9, a pilot and 8 passengers.TMZ can go fuck themselves. Trashy media company.The absolute slowest helicopter crash ever. It\\'s hard to watch even in the context of the movie because it was so emotionalSomeone posted that his sister was on that helicopter. A lot of people were skeptical but he posted he was going to go to the brother in law\\'s show tonight. I looked it up and the brother in law confirmed it on Facebook that his wife died in the crash I think the wife was an assistant coach for the Mamba academy basketball team or somethingAw gosh. That would be very unsettling news. I read it typically is a 2 pilot aircraft, but 9 bodies is still a few uncounted people. Maybe it’s an incorrect number.  Either way this is incredibly tragic.omg two?  I thought it was only his 13 year old daughter....Mm you think so? How come?No. Thanks for asking.No. His other daughter had an anxiety attack when the news broke and had to be rushed to the hospital.My thoughts exactley...That is what the first officer said but I didn’t add it because I honestly don’t know that much about aircraft. After some searching I found this: “This is due to the fact that they are lightweight and can operate under increasingly demanding conditions. Use of Magnesium in Aircraft Parts Casting In recent years, new Magnesium alloy castings has demonstrated superior corrosion performance. Leading to keen interest in magnesium alloys for aerospace applications.” Which can be found [here](http://www.themetalcasting.com/aircraft-parts-casting.html)So yes, magnesium alloy can be used to create an aircraft.When it comes to this aircraft: “The fuselage is of mixed metal and composites construction, with a fiberglass nose and a light alloy honeycomb cabin structure. The semi-monocoque tailboom is also constructed of light alloy.” [here](https://airrecognition.com/index.php/world-air-force-military-equipment-aircraft-/north-america/united-states-air-force/united-states-american-us-air-force-usaf-helicopter-technical-data-sheet-specifications-intelligence-description-information-identification-pictures-photos-images-video-/1550-s-76s-76d-helicopter-technical-data-sheet-specifications-intelligence-description-information-identification-pictures-photos-images-video-sikorsky-sikorsky-aircraft-united-states-american-us-usn-usmc-us-air-force-us-navy-aviation-aerospace-defence-industr.html)And a patent says this: “Housing temperature effects were investigated in light of the fact that the main transmission gearbox housing of the S-76® helicopter series is generally fabricated from magnesium or magnesium alloys (for weight savings), which have a coefficient [...]”. [here](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0629269B1).It was his privately owned helicopter, so they knew he was on it whenever it takes off and you can track that kind of stuff online at flightawareOne way you can find it out is to see where the crash it and then look to see what flight path ended there. Very few flights don’t start or end at an airfieldYeah that’s the kind of thing you tell everyone you know. Like it wouldn’t be a secret that you were going to get to fly in a helicopter with Kobe Bryant this weekend. I’m sure the family and friends of most of the others on board found out from the news.And sorry for your loss, that’s terrible[5 facts about the helicopter](https://heavy.com/sports/2020/01/sikorsky-s-76-helicopter-n72ex-kobe-bryant/)Anyone know why it circled over Glendale?TMZ is basically the CIA of NYC and LA with how insanely deep their network goes through the city and first responder networksTMZ pays for tips. They have a ton of officials who will leak info for money. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was someone at air traffic control or someone with access to flight manifests who leaked it. I’ve lived here my life and actually know someone who works at the Coroner’s Office who leaked the autopsy report of a famous person’s OD recently-for the record he’s trash and he knows that I think that about him.We don’t know if someone is leaking. There were eyewitnesses for the crash and you can check online flight radars to see which airplane (or helicopter) was on that route and has crashed. TMZ probably already knew of Bryant’s schedule and could figure it out. Also, there are police scanners and other channels online that report emergencies. There are more explanations than one, and I’m pretty sure emergency workers sign an NDA when signing their contract. It is possible that someone has leaked information, but it’s far more likely that they figured it out.I’m truly sorry for your lossI get his point, but really there is no good way to find out your loved one has diedNope, they’re not the military. If it bleeds, it leads. Being the first news channel to report something like this could make a young journalist’s career so they’ll be jumping at the chance to publish firstNope. Professional courtesy would dictate that you don\\'t report until the family is notified, but no law. It\\'d go to the Supreme Court as a freedom of speech issue.TMZ would probably argue that it\\'s impossible for them to know whether or not the family was notified.Looks like the brother of one of the deceased found out on Reddit. So awful. He knew his sister was on the helicopter and saw it had come down but hadn’t heard officially 😞That’s what I meant. Edited it already.He wasn’t, the girl was lying. Kobe slept with her and she saw a paycheck[deleted][removed]Reports say there were 9 people in board the helicopterYou know this for fact? Are you the lead reporter?[deleted]I totally made fun of his use of the exclamation point.[deleted]Many rape victims refuse to testify, it\\'s a painful and humiliating process. Add to the fact that Kobe payed her off in exchange for dropping charges, it\\'s not hard to see why she didn\\'t.I respect him so much. I don’t mean to come off as disrespectful. He has impacted my life quite a lot and honest to god I was not trying to be disrespectful in any way[deleted][deleted]Here\\'s the Twitter from back in 2016 from Comedy Central.  [https://twitter.com/comedycentral/status/799341350386708480?lang=en&fbclid=IwAR2rPq3NI33pilKbaj6HIyHEslf-vZTs0PaC85RvXgADw4Jb7IVcs5aHcEk](https://twitter.com/comedycentral/status/799341350386708480?lang=en&fbclid=IwAR2rPq3NI33pilKbaj6HIyHEslf-vZTs0PaC85RvXgADw4Jb7IVcs5aHcEk)Yeah plus five rings roll out.  5 confirmed dead.  Edit: looks like 9.  Why the 5 reported so quickly?Lebron passed Kobe for #3 alltime scoring list.From around 2006-2012 it was on par with Ronaldo/Messi on who the best player in the world was between them as well.oh jeez💔I\\'m just amazed how blind you choose to be. Your hero wasn\\'t a victim. You choose to defend a man who cheated on his wife SEVERAL times and on one of those times he messed with the wrong woman by taking advantage of her. And she chose to put him in the spotlight. He got caught in more ways than one. People talking on his death remembering how he didnt get away with it that time. He was not a saint.  He was a hero in the sports field to many, but it was because of who he was, and the money he had that enabled him to live the life he had, but if he had been anyone now-famous, he wouldve been thrown in jail. HE RAPED a woman. He wasnt a victim by any means. If he had just been faithful TO HIS WIFE none of this would be part of his story.  You cant accept that truth.Like you wouldn’t? Get the fuck out of here.Just because he wasnt convicted and she dropped the charges doesn\\'t mean he didn\\'t do it. There is proof that he admitted to it, but his excuse was \"he thought it was consensual\". He knew better. People get paid off all the time to drop charges when it comes to the wealthy and popular. You can keep turning a blind eye to it just like the rest of his fans, but this is why the me too movement is aliveYou sound like Kobe’s defense attorney. Funny how you slander a 19 year old girl who was choked and ass raped by Kobe but cry like a bitch  if anyone speaks the truth about Kobe.Man, I feel sorry for you. You’re no longer a humanYeah I know but they apologised afterwards for showing footage of the wrong person.Looking at the top comments it’s completely forgotten already and people had already forgotten. I do feel bad for his wife and the rest of his kids but like I said, he was a rapist.I mean he made a pretty damning statement after they settled imo. But yeah he did a bunch of other pretty fucked up shit.Being a piece of shit husband doesn’t come close to rape though. I wouldn’t be calling him out for that if it’s all he did. Rape is inexcusable.Nah. He was a rapist, and that’s how I’m going to remember him.I\\'d rather be a slutty catholic girl than a dead rapist.Comedy Central cartoonAnd people that come to get attention on a thread like this. Troll.Everyone diesMaybe Kobe should have had more tact instead of raping that girlYou know what? Someone told me to Google it. I did.Kobe is a fucking rapist. I\\'m not happy that he is dead, as I\\'m sure he did good for the world as well. But he raped that girl, and he does not deserve to be made out to be some hero. He is a rapist.I’m from the Bay and obviously grew up and still hate the Lakers. The Lakers. Not Kobe or anyone really past or present, it’s just the SF-LA rivalry like NY and Boston or Chicago and St. Louis. I actually always respected Kobe, but never thought I liked him as much until recently. Seeing him be a huge advocate for his daughters, as a dad to a little girl, and the advocacy he’s been doing for women in sports in general has been a great thing to see. I seriously have been shook all day. Can’t wrap my head around it. I seriously equate this as when Princess Diana died or Michael Jackson - Kobe was a global icon. Now reading all the philanthropic initiatives he was getting into, this day will take a long time to get over.I hope your daughter isn’t raped. People will say the same to you if you didn’t properly genuflect at the memory of her rapist if he died and was famous. Think about that. Women matter, and his greatness as an athlete doesn’t wash away what he did.But they make sad ones don’t they?[deleted]Autorotation. I\\'ll take fixed wing any day though.Yup, autorotation. I don’t know the in’s and outs of it so please correct me if I’m wrong, but if I remember correctly it involves using the air rushing through the rotors as the chopper loses altitude, as a way to spin them without using the engine. Then at the last minute you increase the pitch of the rotors using the collective to increase their lift, and use the momentum given to them from the air going through them earlier to provide just enough power to slow the descent rate down to safe speeds. Definitely not the softest landing in the world but most certainly better than falling out the sky like a rockOh. Yeah. That\\'s like a 2.5 hour drive . Would probably save at least 1.5 hours. So sad.Yes.  His 13 year old.The county sheriff just said they believe there were 9 casualties the pilot + 8It seems like a possibility. After checking https://mambasportsacademy.com/bios/, there is no Christina, but there is a Christine who is a coach. Time will tell soon enough.Yeah but back then you probably had more people with less training in flying choppers and you had bullets playing musical chairs with who dies next.I\\'ve lost track of how many stories I\\'ve seen over the past 2 decades of well known people dying in freak accidents related to choppers flown by people with lots of experience.EDIT: for anyone reading my comment it was in reply to the above comment about the military service in vietnam riding huey choppers.Yeah I just found it funny but everyone is so mad about it. I dunnoBut its fucking hilarious?[deleted]I\\'m not outraged. It\\'s certainly at least a bit of a story, though. Because wowzers.And you speak perfectly every second of your entire life? Fuck you.My parents call me an amalgam of my siblings and my names all the time, and they\\'ve been saying our names for years. Get out of here.Or someone unfamiliar with basketball started saying Knicks and tried to correct to Lakers and the combination is very unfortunate.[deleted]Have you seen that video? She may have stumbled over the word Lakers but she still dropped the hard R on live tvLmao she did not pronounce as “Nackers” or “Nickers” for that matter.Yes. Partially cause I was the shortest one on my time. But mainly Kobe. Mamba mentality truly represented his work ethic and athleticism. A loss for all who looked up to him.ебать тебя педикSort by controversial and you\\'ll find themYears ago there were allegations that Kobe raped a girl.It was a big thing, but he was found not guilty.Many people try to believe that Kobe only won because of his wealth and having the NBA on his side.But the fact remains that the girl’s lawyers couldn’t prove shit, so he’s innocent.[deleted]Rich people deserve to die because they are rich? You just blow in from stupid town?I mean I get it, if he raped someone he\\'s a piece of shit but people coming out of the woodwork about it only when its announced that he\\'s dead? Yeah real brave people /syou are right but being a celebrity doesnt change the fact that 5 people died horribly. It just got more exposure.I was there for that, too! 09/02/17.Fuck right off. You make me extremely angry.Your poor kidsI guarantee you know absolutely none of the actual private details whatsoever around that case.  I guarantee it.  And what that means is you know nothing.Your comment is absolutely despicable, Jesus Fucking Christ!You are a loathsome piece of what I\\'m assuming is white trash. There is a special place in hell for people just like you.Holy christ your comment historyYou\\'re trashSo in your mind, this is his just deserts? Him and his daughter dying in a helicopter crash?Where is the source on this?[removed]Yeah, Earnhardt is definitely on that level. And I learned a handful of new stories, thanks.Being somewhat specific is a bad thing?  Okayedit: They die at 1/10th the rate that men do.   So no.  They don\\'t die like men doGood job on not opening the link on the OP youre responding toNo one knows 100% what happened one way or the other. But one thing I do know 100% is that blood and lacerations do not automatically equal rape.Read the post please, it’s clearly answered there. But since you are using a garbage article without any substance, let’s break this down. Yes, he had her blood on her shirt, and there was vaginal trauma. This is not uncommon with consensual encounter, however. As proven by an expert that claimed exactly this. (Which her teamTried to erase as evidence btw LOL)But, what IS weird is: - She bragged to multiple people about the encounter.- Her friend was willing to testify she tried to do this with Eminem. - She has sex very quickly after the encounter. Her team tried to claim she had sex before her encounter with Kobe, but a forensic expert claimed that’s extremely unlikely - She was seen leaving that room without any sign of discomfort. When probed with this, she claimed Kobe told her to wash her face after they were done. Years later, she claimed she made that up. - Her team created a mock trial for her, and she changed her story so many times that she basically had to settle. Please. There’s no way in fucking hell Kobe is a rapist.Man you\\'re white knighting so hard todayBecause he was a married man with one of the best image in sports. No shit. Someone asks a married man if he cheated, and the first answer will always be a no.The fact that this is used against him is fucking insane. Grow upI will never defend him for being a shit husband. But I will always defend him for being labeled a rapist.And it’s mechanical integrity, and the weather conditionsban for ignorance?not trying to start shit here. but the stickied comment isn\\'t implying they\\'ll ban any stupid comments. just ones that are clearly trying to hate and be purposefully insensitive. Op\\'s comment might be dumb but not really against the rules imo. and it can be taken in many ways I think. like not necessarily animositycould just be uninformed. but I also can see how these type of questions aren\\'t appropriate after someone just died.DNA matching blood on his shirt can\\'t be a lieOk goodAlso that. The video crash looks like it was in a ravine, the photo of the crash was on the side of a relatively gradual hillsideNot his oldestWrong. It was his second eldest daught Gigi that died. His oldest daughter is Natalia.Post the link please. Where did you read this?Thank youhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confessionThat’s not what happened https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession?[That\\'s the word for someone who holds left-wing views](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/leftist)You know you can actually come out from under the bridge right?Yes I know. nightmare. kobe was a piece of work but I mean I dont wish serious harm on anyone.It was not thrown out, it was settled out of court for 2.5 million.  Read the details of the case.The case was dismissed cause she wouldn’t testify. She wouldn’t testify cause his peeps leaked her name and she was getting death threats. So fuck you.Don’t engage the trolls, just report them according to the mod sticky.Me firstBut in comparison to commercial airlines? I feel like it\\'s worse with small planes thoughBest animated short Dear Basketball. Written and narrated by Kobe and scored by John Williams.https://youtu.be/ziUc0OCDmoUI believe he won an Oscar for Docu Short for his film, “Dear Basketball”. You can look it up on YouTube.A short film about basketball. I believe it was in 2017 or 2018.Just saw an eyewitness video showing it goes down in an out of control spin before the inevitable fireball.I guess he was not in one of those new invisible government chopper eh, Dale?Did not know this, thanks.That is not the crashThat video and the video news cites are showing have different backgrounds. I think this one is not of Kobes helicopter crashLandscape looks nothing like that.[deleted]Just want to say they worded it terribly.Rick fox isn’t dead, Kobe is still dead.[https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/](https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/)  it\\'s literally on the updates.At least it was a quick and painless death but I can’t imagine what was going through their mind priorThey probably didn\\'t. From what I understand a helicopter is not like a plane. The helicopter goes down much faster and it\\'s basically all chaos and screams. No time for a conversation.Daughters teammate and her father.Of course.The whole point of the comment was that despite the sports rivalry it sucks and we should all rise above it.  Clearly I fucked up and didn’t make that clear.What I meant to express what that despite those things it super fucking sucks that he died.I expressed it poorly, but what I meant was how much his dominance on the court upset me, I still mourn the loss.I was trying to be positive but I failed.  It sucks that he died.Makes that video from the last month of him and his daughter at a game really sad to watchSo tell everyone what you do in the UK to help humanity.  Oh you play video games...  and you want to question my husband who was in the military fighting for baby girls like you.  Weak.I’m sorry. I should have said fly IN helicopters for his job. He’s not a pilot. But everywhere we vacation there are helicopter tours.  He won’t go on them because of the extra risk.  Google how many people die on their honeymoon in helicopters.[removed]Oh no I spoke ill of some one who did some bad shit. I\\'m so horrible? Its not like I... duno... sexually assaulted some one.As for his daughter that\\'s a shame.[deleted]Like no one has ever killed for money? Especially their own kids.Did you mean to reply to me? Who was talking about videogames?As I said above:  It\\'s not about the content.  It\\'s not supporting an evil organization.  If you don\\'t know the difference, I feel sorry for you.I\\'m not saying that they would be biased for this particular story.  Did I say that?  No.  I simply made it easy to find an alternative.   How could you possibly have a problem with that???But, personally, I don\\'t support Fox in anything *because* any advertising revenue they get funds nationwide brainwashing.  I would have purchased 2 Subarus by now, but they have decided to keep advertising on Tucker Carlsons\\' show.Sending you a hug little troll! You obviously need it!Edit: if your name is any indication you’re from NE! I happen to be from there. Moved to LA 15 years ago. So double hugs and GBR!He still has 2 or 3 daughters who will continue his legacy.I just read in an article that someone told him he needed a boy to carry on the legacy and that it takes a real man to raise a boy. Kobe replied \"but it takes a King to make a princess...get in line.\" 👑👑👑👑👑 Dude is the most amazing father, I swear.I mean because only a son has a realistic shot at being the best basketball player in the world. Just the way it is. His daughter will never be as good as any male pro.Guess you don’t remember when he raped a 19 year old woman.That reporter really said that? What an ass.It was on Jimmy Kimmel:https://twitter.com/RoFlo/status/1221547986364268545?s=01https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape/He admitted it to whom ?  Certainly not to you.  Do you have details, or is it just hearsay ?Based on the timestamps details were still coming out. No one knew it was 9 until the press conference, not really much on confirmations.thinking of all of them 🙏Like flowers kinda.  Reddit should have thoseModern way of laying flowers.Oh right Dale Earnhardt was assuming as well.  I remember just being at a loss for words just because it was such a seemingly small crash.[deleted][deleted][deleted]The worst of all IMOSame, I\\'ve never reported comments before until I read some of the most classless loser comments I never thought could be possible in here earlier, like what the fuck.nope, but i wasn\\'t being apologist for him. just recognizing that the wife and daughters he left behind shouldn\\'t be painted with that brush.and before you say it - even if his wife knew and defended it, those kids had nothing to do with it, and anytime a child is left unexpectedly orphaned (or dies before she even hits high school), it\\'s a tragedy.not sure what you\\'re trying to make this into.  cheers for whatever you\\'re into, but i suppose my take is different.  we can agree to disagree, i suppose.wait - not the time to defend the survivors, or not the time to scold the grave-dancers?And his daughter :(  btw appreciate the down votes for waiting for confirmation in this day and age of fake news people, NYT still hadn’t confirmed when I wrote my comment, but we all know TMZ can make no mistakes... smhI can’t ignore it when they break in to what I’m watching drumbshit. There’s actual world changing events happeningSo shit like “made me smile” is acceptable to you when a tragedy occurs.  Got itStill he is a pos for being a cheaterI mean let’s be honest no one really knew Kobe either.  Oh because you watched him play basketball for so many odd years and watched his post game conferences you think you know him?No , the reason that the media  not is talking about the others is because the identities of the passengers besides Bryant are not verified. Once it is verified you will begin to see news that the others that have died. People who are not media have been tweeting about the daughters death for the past half hour. Media will not report news based on word of mouth, until it is proven.Maybe they\\'re trying to notify next of kin before shotgunning the names into the media.Hes not more important but you realize people have special connections with players like himWhat’d they say?Just saw the confirmation too on TMZ Twitter. Wow.why are you here in this thread flaunting your TDS?true but you can still die alot of the time, there was a news article about a homeless man that died in my area, it was in washington news on the channel and the man was really nice and was known throughout the area, so no matter your wealth your chances of dying are still thereYes. This is better.Yes it’s been confirmed by TMZ and ESPNYou sound like a victim.Or hear me out.....she was lyingCorrect. Doesn\\'t prove rape thoughNo shit. It\\'s called defending your self. Why give the police info like that.On Fox News.No.  They already said “Gigi died as well, as reported by TMZ”.  Then she sent a text to a co-worker off camera and said do you see this?  I’m not going to mention it right now.  But this is big.  And then went to commercialThe way the media handles disgusting humans.Go back to sleepyeah I’m sorry that was stupid. I don’t know how to voice my feelings about this I’m sorry I’m still in shockAnd you should feel bad for assuming that one guy fucked up, when the pilot can ignore the controller and NOTHING has come out about how the crash even happened.But he\\'s not, Kobe is just a random celebrity.   Who did some bad things I. Life.  The only reason. People are pretending to care is because he had a jump shot, which is ludicrousi don\\'t see you crying about people dying right this secondCause they kill the good guys.it would be sick to make up a story for internet points about the death of a global icon. But look it up. He has a house in Newport, and I\\'ve lived here 15 years. No disrespect though, and not to detract from the actual important subject.Sorry, he was with a baby boy, didn\\'t know he didn\\'t have a son.The rock’s dad dead? Ozzy osbourne has Parkinson’s? Or did those not happen now? Also Kobe’s 13 year old daughter died with him so what else is newwould not be surprised if it started any sooner.[deleted]Damn. That\\'s horrible.You don\\'t have to know someone personally to feel sad when they die. Similarly, you don\\'t have to know someone for them to be an influence on you when you were younger. This is just sad news man, I don\\'t know what you get out of this by asking questions like that.TMZ confirmed itI have not seen anybody saying they were glad his daughter died.I agree. I just think it’s comical how if you sort by controversial almost every comment is some dickhead calling him a rapist followed by replies along the lines of “shut the fuck up you piece of shit.”We don\\'t know if it was rape.Damn too sad man.I believe this is the ESPN source:>Sources: Kobe Bryant was on his way to a travel basketball game with his daughter Gianna when the helicopter crashed. Those aboard the helicopter also included another player and parent.https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1221537476893925376So his other daughters were not on the helicopter, apparently. Still really sad regardless.Holy fuck that sucks.Right? Not saying she’s racist, but how does she mess up so bad?How do you flub that?No, it wasn\\'t.  There is no way that word should have even been on her mind at a time like this.  Rest in peace to her career.This is most likely fake: listen to the pause before saying the n-word -> doesn\\'t sound natural.There is much more to it instead of a simple wiki link. It isn\\'t that black or white, mate. https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape> When asked how hard he was holding onto her neck, Bryant stated, \"My hands are strong. I don\\'t know.\" Bryant stated that he assumed consent for sex because of the accuser\\'s body language.I forgot the details beyond press conference/wife\\'s $4 million ring but yeah, now I remember these details and even if it was consensual, that\\'s psychotic.Edit: There should definitely be a \"started out as\" before consensual because it definitely didn\\'t end up being consensual.Wish I could answer that, I\\'m learning in a Cessna. But with these kinds of hobbies, there are tools for situational awareness, but shit can go wrong just so fastI was thinking about that, she probably heard about it on social media way before hearing it from family.  How awful.Better than supporting a known rapist because he plays sports!

Terrible, I know - what’s life without worrying about a piece of shit like that, right?[deleted]Definitely especially with Terry Jones and Kobe Bryant in the same week.Yup.  Airplane crashes make the news, car crashes don\\'t, so people think airplanes must be more dangerous when it\\'s the exact opposite.[deleted]I’m so sorry man, that’s so awful. I can’t imagine how you’re feeling right nowThank you! I just want to make sure people know Kobe wasn’t the only one on that helicopter :-(So you hope he\\'s telling the truth and his sister is dead?It’s true. [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/live-updates/kobe-bryant-dead-helicopter-crash-4-others-calabasas-california-2020-01-26/) confirmed it>> Girls\\' basketball coach Christina Mauser killed in crashChristina Mauser, a girls\\' basketball coach, died in the helicopter crash, the Costa Mesa mayor tweeted. Mauser was married to Tijuana Dogs musician Matt Mauser.\"This devastating tragedy gets worse by the hour,\" Mayor Katrina Foley tweeted. \"So much pain for so many local families. Our hearts are broken & grieving for the families impacted.[deleted]It looks like it\\'s true. He mentioned his sister\\'s husband was supposed to perform at the Brea Improv tonight. Quickly looking at their page, it\\'s a Sinatra cover band and on the lead singer\\'s page, someone seemed to give condolences in their most recent post.100 percent true. My hear is racing.[deleted]> convicted rapistThe case was dropped after his accuser refused the testify. Stop making shit up.[deleted]At 6 am I was in the foothills in the valley and it was really misty. Definitely not rainy but something other than a typical fog. The whole hillside wreckage really looks like a classic low visibility crash. However, that S76 is a sweet ship and would very likely have terrain avoidance equipment to warn the pilot. The TMZ report said a witness heard \"sputtering\" but a turbine helicopter doesn\\'t sputter. If the pilot suddenly pulled up the blades would beat hard because of the high angle of attack before it collide with the ground. It would definitely be an audible change in the sound of the aircraft. If the they didn\\'t file a flight plan then 100% they were operating on visual flight rules and I\\'d wager this was controlled flight into terrain.Fox was not on board. Confirmed by his daughter and friend who spoke with him.Fox is apparently alive and wasn’t on board2nd oldestGoing to school the next day on 4 hours of sleep, but it didn\\'t matter because you were so pumped after watching Kobe play...Oh my gosh.  This is just beyond tragic.  Poor Vanessa.  I just don\\'t know how you move on.  Ugh.I\\'m glad that it wasn\\'t all of them but still.  Such a devastating loss.  It\\'s unbearable.CNN is now reporting daughter deadTMZ was first to confirm, it is tmz but they’ve been the most accurate so far... on their way to practiceTMZ confirmedHope things get better.Feed me the downvotes if you want, but the same is happening in 2020 this NovemberI’m already expecting a Trump victory but I’m going to try to have as much hope as I can in the ultimate trash year.[deleted][deleted]No traffic on sundays but still, it’s a stupid comment.Oh noIf you think rape doesn’t count just because someone entered a room with you, *ooooh boyyyyy*People can change their minds. People can consent to certain acts, but not others, and if you choose to go ahead and do what they’re telling you not to do: congratulations! You’re a rapist. Your lack of knowledge about this lead me to believe you’re one of a plethora of men who have raped someone, but are too ignorant and fucked in the head to have realized it. Fuck you. Seriously. You’re the problem.“I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year...  No money has been paid to this woman. She has agreed that this statement will not be used against me in the civil case... I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”These are the words of an innocent man /sBecause he settled out of court and publicly admitted it wasn\\'t consensual...He wasn’t acquitted. The complainant didn’t want to testify, and they settled in civil court for an undisclosed amount and an apology letter. However, her blood was on his shirt, and she did a rape kit which came back in line with non consensual sex. Another employee tried to intervene (was outside the room) but his bodyguards didn’t let the employee in. Establishing guilt in cases of sexual assault is difficult but in his apology letter he literally said she does not and did not consent (though he thought it was consensual). She also had strangulation marks on her neck. It does not matter if he thought it was consensual because it wasn’t, and he himself has said so. He raped a 19-year-old and that fact should not be forgotten.Probably because he was not acquitted?When OJ does, I better not see you mention anything but his football career.Because he paid her enough for her to not testify against him so the case was dismissed. That\\'s not exactly acquittalI did, plenty of times from many articles. This wasn\\'t a recent incidentI am comparing a rapist to a rapist.So yeah I guess.TMZ is actually very accurate with this stuff usually.TMZ is extremely reliable when it comes to reporting deaths.Why? TMZ was the first to report that he was killed. They’re not always wrong.2nd eldestIt was on Fox 11\\'s newscast a few minutes agoPretty much yeahI have tried and failed at every turn, I am now in massive debt, caretaker of a family that never once cares for me, and stuck in a shit town working shit jobs to barely get by... I\\'m just glad I never brought anyone else into this shit life and never will, this cycle dies with me, just not the way I had hopedActually he wouldn\\'t give half a shit because he, like anyone, would have no idea I was saying it, or that I existed...... And? He still did more, was worth more, and was betterSometimes if told by the right comedianHe didnt say joke. Besides, the guy just died. Are the you going on about how he raped her everytime you hear his name? If not, this is not the best time to be going off on this topic.If you are going off on how he raped her everytime you hear someone shout “kobe” while throwing an object at something, you should find other hobbies.And again. The guy just died. Give it some time to spit on his graveApparently it is to you lolhttps://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/4bsedg/an_evening_with_bill_cosby/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfIt is, when it involves rich black person.[deleted]Go on the comments and see what i am talking about. All the talk is about him. Same goes for social media.Ok thanks. I wasn’t sure if either were trueHas that been confirmed by anyone besides TMZ?[Um this is totally inaccurate](https://beatofhawaii.com/hawaii-helicopter-tours/)So they\\'re doing 1500 flights a day?Pray to the Loctite, Amen.whoa TILfuck off with your billionaire bootlicking bullshit.And what if you account for actually wearing your seatbelt? The driving statistics include the fact that 90% of car crash victims aren’t buckled up.I also read somewhere that private planes are much less safe than commercial flights...Yeah fuck helicopters. Although they do save lives, too. Planes can\\'t fly people to the hospital or rescue people stranded in the wilderness.I can see that.  A helicopter drops like a rock if that engine goes out just like an F16. Didnt know they were 85 times more dangerous than driving but I\\'m not surprised.[deleted]Yeah I do.She was probably pressured and/or paid off + NDA.Only because more people drive and driving takes longer meaning it exposes you to danger more.  Per minute traveled, helicopters are easily more dangerous.No it’s not, how stupid are you and the other idiots in this thread?An S-76 helicopter - the type used here - has twin turbines. Turbines don\\'t \"sputter\" like a piston engine, and even if there was a single turbine failure, the other one is capable of supporting flight.>Other two are speculationThat\\'s my point. The news should not be *speculating* on the deaths.It came back in like. . 2016 or 2017.thats how I heard of him. He was the next famous rapist/abuser with chris brown long before i found out he played basketball (am not american).Obviously in this thread that wont go down well... but look at jimmy savile.[https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/](https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/)Not sure how credible this is although confirmed.[deleted]They deleted their comment. It said \"I wish Trump died then this guy.\" The wrong then was in the original comment.[removed]Yeah, really holding him accountable by posting a comment in a reddit thread. I\\'m sure he\\'s really feeling like he\\'s facing the judge and jury right about now. Oh wait. He\\'s dead.That\\'s why it\\'s not the time nor place to bring this up. He\\'s dead, posting a comment about his past allegations in the thread reporting on his death is pretty useless.Look two comments above this one :)Just underaged drunk and obnoxious and jumping on tables yelling and giving security a hard time because “don’t you know who I am” Hollywood entitlement.  I’m glad he has matured and also really has become one of my favorite actors.  This was back in the era and scene when River Phoenix died.Why would you automatically assume he’s lying? Kinda embarrassing dudeI would never make shit up. Zero to be gained by doing that.  Kobe is and was my favorite player and I’m a lifelong Laker fan.Yeah and Leo would have been 22 at the time, so not under aged...Well I don’t really know what that means and I also don’t know why anyone would think I made it up, what does my post history tell you that doesn’t jive?*Wade Boggs has entered the chat*Andre Drummond has a beer diet for extra calories. There was an article I believe by espn. Don’t just say shit, you know?NFL linemen eat and drink all kinds of stuff you wouldn’t expect would be part of an “athlete diet” just to maintain their incredibly large weight.That\\'s insane, almost all of them drink, alot of young players have awful diets.I can safely say that is not the case.  The club I worked at had quite a lot of pro athletes and we served them quite a lot of booze.Word on the street is real. It was 4 AM and it was in the gym at UCI. I can\\'t  imagine waking up before 4 to go to the gym and hit a workout...dang.Exactly.  My impression at the time was that he wasn’t the type to pollute his system with alcohol.I originally read that as \"practice shouting\", and still didn\\'t think anything of it.  This is so sad, I still can\\'t believe it.Here\\'s a good one -- Kobe raped someone in 2003.Saw him and his family dining at the Yardhouse in Newport Beach several years ago. Totally nonchalant. Super polite and nice to fans. Also saw him at the gym once. No meaningful interactions but ...I burst into tears several times today as I cleaned my garage listening to KPCC talk about him all day. May he and the other victims Rest In Peace.Maybe nothing from 2003... we will wait a day.I saw Kobe Bryant at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.A 19-year-old female concierge brought Kobe to his room. He asked her to return later to give him a tour of the hotel. She did so. At the end of the tour, he asked her to enter his room. She did. She said there was flirtation and consensual kissing. When he began groping her, she said, she tried to get away. He grabbed her by the neck, and she feared for her life. He bent her over a chair and removed her panties. She said twice that she begged him to stop but he penetrated her anyway. She left about five minutes later. Her clothes were messed up. She was upset. There was blood on her panties and on his shirt. That blood matched her DNA.Edit: why am I being downvoted for telling a true story? Fuck you horrible people that can’t accept Kobe had faultsIt tasted like piss. Because that’s how Evian do.My assistant had a framed picture of he and Kobe looking like best friends.  He worked as an usher at Staples.  One day he asked if he could get a pic and Kobe took it to the extreme and spent a while hanging out and mugging for pics with him.  By all accounts I know he was incredibly generous and patient for his fans.I think you may be slightly overestimating some of those names.I\\'ve tried to never rape anyone... Been successful so far.Oh trust me, no one is going to remember me or you or 99.8% of people.[deleted]Thank you for your kind words and may peace be with you as well.  ❤️They didn’t know. The article says the pilot was too low and tried going higher but ended up hitting the mountain. So on the bright side, what little bright side there is in this tragedy, they didn’t know what was coming and they probably didn’t die in painI\\'m so sorry.  It\\'s not a fun club to be a member of.Thanks.  It was 5 years ago but it\\'s amazing how all the memories and emotions came flooding back.Death doesnt discriminate.>Only two people could possibly know the truthPhysical evidence can\\'t lie. It can only be... and it is \"not consistent with consensual sex.\">The Wikipedia article makes it seem like it was a consenting encounter at first and Kobe\\'s into the kind of stuff that you should probably talk about first. You can withdraw consent at any time. I\\'ve seen this comment from you a couple times, so I feel like I need to address it.Ladies and Gentlemen: Anyone can revoke consent during sex, at any time. Sex is not a right. Bodily autonomy is a right. The MOMENT sex stops being consensual, and one party continues against the wishes of another, it is rape. She said NO. NO is very clearly revoking consent. If your partner says no, or even seems to be having a bad time, STOP, then ask if they are ok and try to clarify if there are any misunderstandings. The MOMENT they seem like they are having a bad time, STOP and TALK. Make sure they want to continue. She did not consent to most of the act, and he kept on. I know in 2003 I didn\\'t know that I could withdraw consent at any time, but this woman did withdraw consent, and Kobe ignored her when she was saying NO, because \"her body language...\". That\\'s rape. Something starting consensually is totally fucking meaningless if it doesn\\'t continue to be consensual the entire time.In 2001 my roommate was raped by two men. They invited her to a party at a hotel, and when she arrived she was the only one there. She was raped. There was evidence. But she had consensual sex with one of the men a week earlier, so the detectives turned on her and basically told her she needed to retract her accusation. I was there for all of the aftermath. I took her to the hospital, was with her during the whole exam, and was with her when she gave all of her statements. Despite all of that, as well as being the daughter of a criminal defense attorney (former prosecutor), I too thought that her havjng prior consensual sex meant she was not raped.  Looking back on that now, I am horrified for her. The cops pressured her super hard to drop it. I encouraged her to let it go. She was a high school senior, and she was so broken after that. I remember thinking months later, \"She is really milking this,\" (No one else knew about the prior consensual sex), but now I just think, \"Not even 20 years ago the cops were sure she was lying because of 1 piece of evidence, while dismissing all the other evidence supporting rape.\" That\\'s fucked up. I\\'m glad we\\'re talking about consent in very different terms these days.[deleted]Damn, if that\\'s true i hope not another member of the family.Not looking that way.[deleted]Unfortunately TMZ is source of eldest daughter.  They are as reputable as they come in news like this.Source for the 17 year old?

Single mother and lost a child, and these vultures will come after her when she is vulnerable. And their poor daughters :(. One isn’t even a year old yet. Just horrible.Imagine the people who have this happened that aren\\'t millionaires.Thanks for the info, my b for misinformation, it’s what family told meI believe your full of shit and that the the time he raped a hotel employee up the ass probably wasn’t the first last and only time he wasn’t faithful to his wife.I truly don’t give a fuck.  I’m annoyed I’ve even spent this much time thinking about this guy.  I’m sorry for his kids that he’s dead but truly don’t give a fuck about a washed up old basketball player and rapist.  Can’t figure out why anyone else would either.this is real life...Kobe’s in my seat13 year old daughter being reported dead as well.It seems that one daughter was on board[TMZ said one daughter on board](https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)I have heard conflicting reports on that.

Also who was flying the helicopter if 5 were killed?Impossible. Who the fuck was flying the chopper?This was stated by ABC incorrectly and then the tweet was deleted. No other major news outlet is stating that information.[deleted]Including the infant?Scratch that TMZ now saying his 13 year old daughter was on itNot everyone tweets personally. Some have a publicist or social media manager.https://twitter.com/WPLGLocal10/status/1221531515961708544?s=20I’m sorry for your loss.The ATC audio has been leaked/released, pilot was responsive all the way until the end with no signs of distress. With all the fog there was probably no moment of realization what was about to happen, just over in an instant - so tragic but oddly comfortingWow I fell into a hell of a rabbit hole with that oneThat second part,  I think of that constantly. The most recent before this helicopter crash was the Iranian plane shot down a few weeks ago.There is a recording of Kobe??SAME. What’s wrong with us??I can sympathize with your pain.  I had a not-quite-similar experience on a military aircraft in Afghanistan once, where we had an in-flight emergency situation on a C-130 that forced a landing at the nearest airfield.  Well they didn\\'t tell us squat (No intercom system for passengers in a C-130), and the \"airfield\" was a gravel runway, it was 3 am on a cloudy night, so when we hit the ground it sounded like we were ditching and I was just thinking \"Oh shit, this could be it for me.\"Then two weeks later I was in a Chinook that was dangerously over loaded and broke down as we were landing.  We hit the ground pretty hard, but luckily we only fell like 20 feet.Before then, I was an avid flyer and loved being in the air.Now, when I get on long flights, I pop two ambien at cruising altitude and sleep to the destination.  When I get on short flights I do everything I can to distract myself from the fact that I\\'m flying.What if your family with you on that flight? It is the worst thought for me. I better die alone, knowing they are ok.I\\'ve never been on a plane and after reading that shit I never fucking will.  Thank youThat is crazy. Thankfully u made it thoJust a note on this from a pilot - if pressurization is lost, emergency descents are very common and they can be scary, but completely safe. The idea is you need to get below 13000 feet to get to air that is thick enough to keep the passengers breathing well, I highly doubt you lost engine power - most likely they were just idled on the way down, which can sound silent.The fact that you fly still after something like that shows how much of a beast you areAre you sure you were falling down, or the pilots were nose diving to a sustainable altitude?I think 10,000 feet is there is enough oxygen to breathe “normally” and the plane may have just been trying to get there as to not deprive all the passengers of oxygen. Also, do you mind if I ask what incident this was?If it\\'s any consolation, the plunge wasn\\'t due to power loss, it was an emergency descent to get to a more breathable atmosphere due to cabin pressure lossIt’s funny how different people handle stress differently.  I’ve had two emergency landings in aircraft, one in which I deliberately chose to “crash” the aircraft to keep things from getting worse.  The aircraft smelled like it was on fire (failed regulator), and there was a large obstacle at the end of the runway, so I put the landing gear in a ditch in a turn, and ripped it off to stop the plane before I hit the obstacle.  I was at 20 hours or something at the time.It’s one of a couple of near-death experiences I’ve had over the years - one in a car (black ice + 8% grade is not fun), one being hit by a car (mine, rolling down a hill and crashing me into a building), and one in a cave.  Far from being traumatic, I find facing death peaceful, and joy at surviving.(Me [after getting run over](https://imgur.com/a/dvfD220), a tiny bit of blood but not much).  I couldn’t stop smiling with joy.  It just struck me in the moment that I went through something that has killed a lot of other people.  Thousands of pounds of car rolled down the car, smashed me through the window hard enough to break safety glass, smashed me against the bars, and the car *bounced*, and somehow I *survived*.The funny thing is that my mother can’t fathom how an atheist (like me) can get up in the morning, with the constant possibility of death.  Death doesn’t frighten me at all - I spent most of eternity not existing, so I don’t worry about spending the rest of eternity doing the same.  The process of *dying* concerns me, at least the slow type, so I have things in place to ensure that I can die if it comes to that.I’m happy you’re still here. ❤️If you lost cabin pressure the pilot would dive the plane to 10,000 feet as fast as the plane could withstand because at that altitude the plane does not need to be pressurized.  Passengers have about 15 minutes of air in those masks that drop down.  After that you would be unconscious and die soon after unless you get to a safe altitude.Wow, I\\'ve never heard of this happening..Any insight into what happened to the plane yo make it do that? How long does it take to lose 20,000 feet in altitude?Were you flying in an American based airline?What? What else could’ve been more unexpected? Coronavirus, WW3, Impeachment, that’s all whatever. No one could have foreseen Kobe’s death today.I understand that, but we all should respect those who passed.Nobody credible, don’t spread unconfirmed shit[deleted]I just don’t want it to be trueI just want to think not this timeI know, I think I need to feel this isn’t trueFrom my dad whose trying to watch the coverage. I’ve heard that there were two daughters and some family friends and I’ve heard there were three daughters were on board. All of this is horrible, but it would be nice to know no daughters were involved.Hey at least you and Kobe both like/liked shoving things angrily in peoples asses...What part of fuck hero worship did you not understand?He was no more important than those other four souls....fuck you.And fuck you in particular.Ya\\'ll need to get celebrity dicks out of your fucking mouths and realize ALL life is important.Where was the fanfare and outpouring of emotion when my Mother died?Where was the fanfare and outpouring of emotion when I lost my best friend?***KOBIE BRYANT*** and ^^^^^^^^four ^^^^^^^^other ^^^^^^^^people ^^^^^^^^died....Go fuck yourself.[removed]/u/Staanko raped me. Rapist! Nobody defend this rapist.Hashtag - Her TooOf course. Even considering that she had semen from other encounters before she slept with Kobe. Typical skank trying to impregnate herself to  secure the bag. That\\'s all it was.TMZ now saying one of his daughters was on board. 13 years old.They were also the first to report Prince’s death. Do you know if they were one of the news sources to report that Tom Petty had passed away before he did?Or it does mean something\\'s wrong and it\\'s just been wrong forever.I heard it on the radio when I was in my car earlier.  But it turns out Rick was not on board.  My apologies.I heard it on the radio when I was in my car earlier.  But it turns out Rick was not on board.

There’s still hope for the daughters.They just backpedaled on that.[deleted][deleted]Looks like 1 of his daughters was on board :(https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/kobe-bryant-dead-at-41-in-helicopter-crash.htmlwhy are people just saying \"stuff\" - what a horrible thing that would beI\\'m trying not to laugh during this dark time thank you very much - but I guess I deserved such a responseHe seems to be on the spectrumYes thanks.Kobe Bryant flew a helicopter every week. It\\'s literally how he gets around. He\\'s a pilot.Prove itSure, rapist supporter.Kobe flew his own helicopter.It\\'s hilarious, he\\'s even from Philly. You barely have to change the lyrics.Now this is a story all about how.      My helicopter got flipped turned upside down.    And I\\'d like to take a minute, just sit right theresomeone here said they were “inside-out blenders full of explosives” and I think its pretty accurate😢 so sad and so young, ABC first reported that daughters were on board.That’s good news.Impossible. Who the fuck was flying the chopper?Umm, statistically, nope. [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/06/are-helicopters-safer-than-cars.html](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/06/are-helicopters-safer-than-cars.html) Driving is actually 85 times more dangerous than helicopters.Mostly who would want to take a newborn on a helicopter ride!?[deleted]That’s an awesome memory. gotta love the impact this guy had on so many people.Apparently someone on ABC news said it was his daughters but I can\\'t find any actual sources, I really hope not ugh...Look up ClayWPLG on Twitter. He tweeted that ABC confirmed it.Oh wow, that\\'s so sad. Condolences to his wifeImpossible. Who the fuck was flying the chopper?Kinda but I mean he was known for using a helicopter as transportation for yearsTMZ has confirmed information from Kobe’s reps. Twitter and someone aren’t exactly reliable sources though, so I’m taking unconfirmed rumors with a grain of salt.Don’t want to be vulgar, but his youngest was barely 6 months old. If it’s true, she could still be missingI pray that’s not the case.  Damn.I mean, if he did then who cares about respect? Fuck him and good riddanceIf he didn\\'t, this is absolutely tragicTragic for the others on the chopper tooI dont understand all reports were saying 4 other people were on board.  Wouldnt at least one or two people be needed to operate the helicopter?  Seems impossible that all four of his kids could be on board if there were only 5 people total.Eww, youre gross.Still a lot of development to the story, I’m sure. This is just what I saw ABC report. If true or otherwise, it’s still awful for all those involved.Thank goodness this wasn’t true. Still unimaginably tragic for their family. Devastating.I’m very glad this wasn’t true.Not confirmed. ABC reported then said “not confirmed”ABC news.He didn\\'t though.I never testified either. Doesn\\'t mean I wasn\\'t assaulted[deleted]Yeah but giving awards that are called ”Yassss Queen or Wholesime” is a bit too reddit[deleted]From what I\\'ve read it burst into flames after crashing. It\\'s still developing so we should wait a bit before assuming what exactly happened.My initial point still stands though. Do not fly in a helicopter in foggy conditions, and judging by the photos fog was present.He might’ve been flying it.Ah, did they say 5 people total including the pilot?Fapping probably. In any case, not taking my chances!1 daughter was on board only.Good god. This is awful.Can you link?[deleted]Yeah wtf is he even on?I doubt the other deceased nor their family gives any fucks about getting “RIP”s in a Reddit threadThey announced on ESPN that his daughters were on the helicopter with him. I hope they misspokePeople keep saying that but I have read zero reports, outside of reddit, saying as much.His daughters didn’t deserve to die, but rapists do.Is Kobe a pilot? CNN is saying it was his personal helicopterI guess he was?[removed]They did say that in ESPN.are you saying he wasn’t a sexual predator?Yes it doesn’t make sense. I can’t believe he would be the pilot.Probably 5 on board meaning passengers? Idk.Rapists tend to be unreliable narrators. Especially when they pay for the victim\\'s silence.He meant she liedReporter just came on and said he misspoke. Thank God.Rick Fox? Where you seeing that?It\\'s meant to say having a death that only rich people will ever have.I\\'ve noticed. The praise Bush Sr. got when he died made me want to throw up. Can\\'t wait to see how whatever the future version of reddit is like when Bush Jr. dies. I\\'m sure everyone will be typing out RIPs and praising him for being such a good president. People are fucking stupid. lolNah, it definitely means he should\\'ve died and that this death wasn\\'t sad. Have someone rape your daughter then tell me how you feel about the person. We\\'re suppose to care about this guy because he was a grown ass man who never had a real job and just threw balls into hoops for a living? That somehow excuses his actions? lol, fuck this dude. Rot in hell mother fucker.the truth being what? that he was never actually convicted of a crime and that you don’t like basketball? and that despite millions of people being deeply affected by the violent death of someone they love, you feel like it’s important for us to know that you don’t give a shit? what strain of narcissism are you fucking smoking my dude?5:45 UTC is 9:45 pacific.If you follow the flight track it left SNA but did not land at El Monte.Yeah 0 commentary on that part.And I get how big Kobe was but there were other people on board noone is reporting on who are being dwarfed by Kobe, which I could get but if it\\'s his kids also? OofAnd they just gloss over the kids comment and this whole thing is just unbelievably horrible.This assumption was quite the leap... Especially now that it\\'s confirmed to be wrongI don\\'t remember the story but I recently watched a clip of kobe winning the jam contest at 18 years old.She was in the stands, the announcer showed her and told the prom story. I think she won a beauty contest or something right before.It was a two way street. Yes Shaq got jealous of the attention Kobe got, but Kobe wasn’t always the best teammate. FWIW, most of the team sided with Shaq. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i2BGcbYpO3wABC reported that it was him and his four kids on board. Not 100% confirmed yet tho so I hope it\\'s fake news.Yup DNA evidence and his own admissionOne was an infant. Maybe not counted in a manifest?Just repeated what ABC News just said is all.[deleted]They mentioned it once, no one else is reporting as of right now.  Definitely not confirmed.[deleted]His daughter Gianna, who was only 13, was on the helicopter as well. To me, that made the whole thing 10x sadder. That little girl had Kobe’s same love and compassion for basketball, and wanted to be in the WNBA. She had dreams. I feel so awful for Kobe’s wife. She lost her baby girl and husband. It’s awful to know that Kobe has to watch his daughter be scared during the crash. I’m sure there was nothing else on his mind at that moment other than his daughter. So so so sad.Wait, the other four passengers were his kids?Confirmed as fake.I only heard it once so far. It was during the news break in the nfl game. Couple tweets saying so as well but it doesn’t make sense to me because they said it was Kobe and all 4 daughters. That would mean 6 people on board including the pilot...I haven’t seen this reported anywhere, yet people keep saying it.I’m guessing just the older three daughters??? Since there were 5 on board. Pilot, Kobe + 3 daughters. Doubt the newborn would be flying.God damnBuying silence isn’t paying duesReally? The daily news? Might as well link \"The Onion\" or \"The Daily Mail\". Do you believe The Daily News when they speak of Alien Invasions too?Bragging about having sex with Kobe Bryant doesn’t mean he didn’t rape her.Rape is a very traumatizing incident and people will try to rationalize it.\"Other friends have said the woman was stunned and upset after the June 30 incident\"they put the quote from the one guy who said \"happy\" in the headline thoughHer story was that the sex was consensual until the analthis should clear it up for you...kobe was a rapist. [https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession)It wasn’t taken to criminal court because she gave up. And who could blame her. Bryant’s lawyer and the media absolutely slaughtered her and dragged her through the mud. She couldn’t take anymore. So that’s why due process didn’t happen.I linked the video I heard it in but haven’t heard it anywhere else yet so crossing fingers this was a mistake[deleted][deleted]Look into it. Maybe you\\'ll understand. He paid for it to go away.Jesus, this is fucking me up.The reports have said 5 passengers have deceased. Not sure if he has his pilot’s license.Cheers good sir 👊I mean, aren’t fingerprints and dental records typically used to identify the deceased? Or does this imply that the bodies were severely damaged?Thought that might have been due to... burning? Oh god :(It’s heavily rumored that they have authority members across all agencies on their payroll, including hospital personnel who are essentially breaking HIPPA in exchange for money.Remember how Rihanna’s assault pictures were leaked?Yeah, I remember.There’s no such thing as too low for them.whoa thats crazy .. all they have to do is just text TMZ that it happenedYeah sounds like a car crash but worse. R.I.PBut how fast was it? I hope the crash happened so quickly they had no time to understand or feel anything.However, recent reports mention that the pilot made questionable adjustments to flight altitude during the final minutes before the crash, in no-vision conditions, so I’m guessing they were already anxious and fearful before what happened 😥Its been confirmed officially by many sources. He was identified by his fingerprints, meaning his body must have been burned past recognition. His daughter has not been formally identified thoughOk I was being a little over simplistic. The Gs don\\'t kill you it\\'s everything around you that smushes you to bits in a crash like this. Aircraft have to hold more than one person (generally), be light enough to actually fly, AND be economical to produce. Every example you gave was a purpose built, incredibly expensive single seat racing machine where the occupants are strapped into a tiny space and suited/secured up for the expectation that they may have to survive an extreme crash. That\\'s not the expectation in commercial, or even private flight. That\\'s not the expectation in normal driving. That should never be the expectation for either. There are single seaters that are built similarly to F1 chassis now in the flying world, and do just as extreme things as F1 drivers. The technology has transferred over from both, but you don\\'t see land vehicles that can hold 10 people and protect them from a 180+ MPH crash safely, because F=MxA. Not sure why you\\'d expect anything different for air travel.We have the technology and capabilities, however corporations are too damn greedy and not willing to spend money for such technological advancement. The materials, development and testing are not worth human lives to them.My best idea, have a fiber glass shell that is designed to shatter and dissipate crash energy eith it. Within the fiber glasss shell have another aluminum innershell that is designed to crumple and absorb additional energy, then have another Mangalloy layer that is designed for maximum strength, then within the Mangalloy have another Carbon Fiber monocoque that is ultrastrong that WILL NOT Shatter. Within the Mangalloy shell you will have dampers (air springs) that the Carbon Fibre Monocoque Floats on. Then within the Carbon Fiber monocque you will have additional airbags for occupant safety. The Mangalloy passenger structure could have airbags outside between the aluminum as well for additional crash dampening. Basically the idea is having a fuesalage made of these materials :Fiber Glass: will shatter and provide initial energy dissipationAluminum: will crumple and help absorb energyMangalloy and with airbags: strong metal material to prevent passenger cell intrusion and provide cusion to further reduce harsheness of impact.Carbon Fibre Monocoque: (I\\'m taking this technology from F1 and Indy Car). The Carbon Fibere Monocque will house passengers and is designed not to break, absorb crazy forces and it will stay intact. There will also be airbags and advanced seats with dampers to help with passenger deceleration.Will all this work? I\\'m not sure i\\'m not physicist or anything like that lol, but watching F1 cars and Indy cars crash shows me that you want to have sacrificial layer(s) then a strong passenger compartment that is the carbon fibre monocoque.All this stuff will sound crazy to anyone now, but i\\'m sure in the 1960s planes and rockets sounded crazy to anyone that was still alive from the 1800s.  We have to think differently to make progress.What we are going for is not only to absorb crash energy and keep the structure intact but soften the impact, becuase humans are soft. Passengers will also have advanced seats and cushioned harnesses. We need to make sure that none of that fatal crash energy reaches the occupants.Now within my design I found some flaws... no entry or exit door, windows, fire risk, weight, how much power needed to make it fly... Umm... well maby that can be figured out later.I got super bored and made a terrible design in microsoft paint, it\\'s not even in the shape of a helicopter, nor does it have an entry or exit door. Just my general idea of what i\\'m going for regarding crash design and passenger survival.The things between the monocoque and mangalloy shell are air/spring dampers meant to absorb crash energy so a minimal amount makes it to the passengers. I just like to think freely, if it won\\'t work fuck it at least we tried.[https://i.imgur.com/dq2VXkp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dq2VXkp.jpg)[deleted]I don\\'t even know what point you\\'re trying to make child.Based on the way you responded, I hope you\\'re 12. Otherwise, I feel bad for you.He didn’t rape anyone, you really think an icon like Kobe would have to rape someone? Women were throwing themselves at him and one chick decided she wanted to get some money out of it.I just wanted to inform you of what happens when power is cut. Not to make you pick a side or anything.If you\\'re ever curious you just gotta look up \"autorotation\".I knew about Michael Jordan of course, because there were several people in high school who wore his trainers. He was far more famous than Bryant, even to people who never watched basketball. I\\'m shocked at the dislike i\\'ve uncovered simply for daring to suggest Bryant isn\\'t a household name throughout the world.I get out plenty, just not a basketball fan sorry. Don\\'t know any basketball fans either. The only time i even heard his name was on a Bill Burr podcast and i thought he was an american football player.I\\'m sure he is, amongst basketball fans. Just saying the average person outside the US doesn\\'t know who he is. To compare his death to John Lennon\\'s is a little extreme.The pilot requested to fly lower (not higher) in the air space due to the fog ceiling.Couldnt tell you tbh[deleted]No, I read that with two turbines it can sustain flight with one engine malfunctioning, very safe helicopter with an impeccable safety record.It\\'s not \"like\" or \"dislike.\" It\\'s supposed to be \"contributes to the conversation\" or \"doesn\\'t contribute to the conversation.\" This isn\\'t facebook.Maybe they have to notify next of kin first.Except the numerous reports with the total death counts lmaoDo you need everyone on reddit to be asking about the pilot to feel validated?[deleted]Mann you dont know shit.. take youre pathetic ass on somewhere... People like you make this world sickning.His daughter lived the life of a spoiled queen. While being a dumbass millennial kid throwing a ball around. She should have been focused on math, chasing boys and language arts like all 13 year olds. Instead she is living the life of a celebrity. She felt no pain in her death, no suffering. She also experienced more in 13 years than 99% of the world does due to her fathers wealth. This is the definition of karma you ignorant bitch.She was ON HER WAY TO A CHILDS BASKETBALL THING IN A HELICOPTER FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME. Jesus you millennial fucks need to learn the definition of karma. American capitalism isnt some never ending royal family based on income bro.That’s not how news works. Follow what drives eyes & ears. They are after all a business.Got that right. I still feel for his family they lost a loved one as well.These types of investigations take months.Yeah, so there’s your answer. There’s still a lot to investigate[deleted]You can trivialize anyone\\'s job like that.  Durr, Bill Gates just tinkered around with electricity which already exists in nature anyway.  That is how ridiculous you sound.What you can\\'t as easily dismiss is the hard work and dedication that both individuals put into their craft to become renowned as the best or close to the best.Both people in this example would be mourned.  All famous people are mourned and the fact that you think that is depressing just illuminates your narcissistic sociopathic characteristics.  The more \"important\" people in the world will also be mourned by the masses, especially depending on how they die and at what age.I love when people call those that were poor or middle-class growing up privileged after they become rich because it is hilarious.  You\\'re admitting that his hard work was something that society found valuable.  Just because you have no interest in him or his sport doesn\\'t mean a significant percentage of the population don\\'t, and you not being able to understand or care about that is why you\\'re a sociopath.  People need to be entertained to de-stress themselves--some do it with art, some with video games, and some with sports.Maybe you don\\'t realize how often he flew in a helicopter.No, saying he is guilty based on quite literally nothing is spreading misinformation. There is no reason we cannot give him the benefit of the doubt.Probably after seeing their comment.Based on?? Her word? What makes a white womans word more reliable than his?People will tell you because he was *found* innocent, he must not have done it. Out of court settlements are a huge red flag. Law is about money first, then morality if there is any room left.Is he innocent because someone claims he is?What\\'s this supposed to mean? I never said anything about ghosts.Edit: thanks for the upvote to the person who gave it to me. You don\\'t have to agree with what I say, but PLEASE don\\'t say i said something when i CLEARLY didn\\'tHe never did man. What if your father died and was slandered after the fact?Come on man! When my father passed away, I\\'m sure glad no one joked about it! Death is no laughing matter. I\\'ve got a good sense of humor, but death is the last thing on my mind when it comes to comedy. Time and place. Not trying to jump on you or anything like that,  just gets to me that\\'s allIt will take at least a week - if not more - for the NTSB to issue a report. From the flight tracker web sites, it looks like the helicopter burst into flames upon impact, which is not uncommon in any vehicle crash.I can tell you that there are pictures of the crash site all over the internet, and a cliff was not involved. The helicopter crashed into a hillside. As far as I know, no one has reported on whether or not the pilot crashed into the hillside due to visibility or engine failing to keep altitude. My guess is the latter.As far as lebron, mj said kobe was better and then like a day later this happened. This is kobe after his prime. \"Kobe Bryant Embarrasses Lebron James at the All Star Game\" https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/all-star-kobe-bryant-lebron-james-chris-paul-lakers/2056002/Kobe and MJ both are one away from having twice the first team all nba defense awards as lebron.Find the tweet link directly from twitter and i\\'ll believe it.

I am virtually no contact with my dad and sister. But we spent a good 2 hours on the phone today talking about how favorite Laker moments over the last 20 years. That\\'s the only thing we will ever agree on. Honored to be able to witness some of the best games in NBA history in person at Staples.It sounds like you are still close with your family. I wish I could trade for that.You just repeated half of my statement, confirmed it and called it a narrow viewpoint. Amazing.When you\\'ve either buried enough in-laws are pets that the family had over 30 years there are moments when you would love just to go sit someplace and break down but you can\\'t you have to be there for everyone else even if it\\'s just to dig the hole for the carcassLinks to the maps pleaseGrammar? What is this high school? You don’t know the full story of what happened that day. She decided not to pursue charges anymore for a reason. Nuff said.More details will come out as the investigation takes place, but I believe there were details that the pilot was also circling the area to get clearance to enter the airspace because other aircrafts were in the area. Not a pilot, but there were also discussion about helicopters having the ability to fly with limited/no visibility.Obviously as people with limited knowledge, it’s easy to shake our heads, but we gotta remember this is probably a pilot that’s done this a lot and probably very familiar with this route. The pilot is also responsible for their own life too, so I would doubt they’d be wreckless endangering themselves.Google says he drives a Kia. But I\\'m sure he has a chauffeurhttps://twitter.com/ip_Guy_/status/1221534687006380032?s=20You seem to define things like a young child[deleted]Another perspective- we don\\'t need to get on the rooftops and shout down any perceived social injustice, especially not on the day said person died. The pain you cause people by writing this is not equal to whatever cause your think you\\'re trumpeting by doing that.That is the dumbest excuse I’ve ever heard. Literally every news article I’ve seen mentioned his daughter and the 7 others (including two other girls on the basketball team), though most aren’t naming the others (though they’ve been confirmed by other sources) out of respect for the families who haven’t officially been notified as they ant ID the bodies. If the queen of England died in a car crash with 5 other people? Would you expect the majority of people commenting to talk about the queen or the 5 people they don’t know anything about? He was a public figure for Christ’s sake, what do you expect people to do?Being accused of rape does not make someone a rapist.He was accused, he admitted to having sex with her, she wasn’t that credible (lied during her interview, had another dude’s semen and hair on/in her when she went for the rape kit) and bailed on the criminal trial herself when prosecutors were ready to argue the case and she opted for a civil suit instead. They settled out of court and part of the settlement was that he had to publicly apologize and acknowledge that they had different accounts of what happened. The man was never accused of any other impropriety in his life, was recognized as a loving father, a tremendously hard worker and a mentor to hundreds of not thousands of up and coming male and female basketball players. People like to shit all over famous people, and that’s fine, but the man died with his 13 yo daughter today and people can at lest be respectful of her and not be assholes about her dad today.[deleted]According to this article, helicopters are between 27 & 85 times more dangerous to driving. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/06/are-helicopters-safer-than-cars.html\"9/11 happened? Let\\'s give this guy platinum, as well as the mod who condescendingly told us to keep it cool!\"so you\\'re basically saying you can\\'t get a date? jk 😉🤣😂 why so angry little man? lulz.Well, there\\'s a lot of us here.[deleted]Add to that the weather is usually really good except they very few days it isn\\'t gives the pilot little recent experience.I\\'ve seen this happen to other aviation accidents, NTSB usually blames the pilots decision to fly into known fog, get disoriented and finally CFIT.That is what makes this more tragic.. it was sad enough when it was thought to be engine failure .. then we find out likely pilot errorI agree. The report at tmz sounds like it came from somewhere. But at the end of the day, I guess it is still a gossip rag, even if mostly reliable. They were wrong about number of victims, so they aren’t infallible.I guess I read 185 mph into the side of a hill, and I’m not surprised ther are no survivors. But like I said, I’m not an expert. It just sounds tragic. Plane, car, etc., hitting something immovable at that speeed, I’d expect the same. My I’m not a physicist. Literally just repeating what some others have said. What qualifies this as a controlled crash?> I’m certainly not going to argue with a perfect strangerProceeds to whine for 4 paragraphs.Ah yes. Reddit. Where one posts something to initiate a response, then gets offended when such response occurs. You mean that Reddit? Matt?I\\'m with you man.  I fucking hate flying.Dude, I don’t even watch basketball. Stop assuming you know me. Go play with your guns.> Kobe was most likely in a rush eWill do and you should stop making assumptions as well.It appears they removed large portions of the bodies, not just bits and pieces.  A helicopter crash would not display the “bits and pieces” like a plane crash normally would.  Plane crash usually is a lot faster and coming from a much higher location.  Very violent.  Helicopter, while violent and this one was flying fairly fast, they didn’t have for to travel prior to impact.  Similar to what a crash of a high speed car chase would be (yet admittedly magnified a bit more).   The way I look at it, the body parts from a plane falling from high altitude will look dramatically different than a plane crashing upon landing in a bit of a controlled manner.   The bodies would be more recognizable in this case with the helicopter than I think we are imaginingWhen you see them move the body bags, there were large, bulky deposits within.   One general location they kept going to before the coroner was there.   I’m assuming there was a way to identify the body.Note; it could also be that all of the bodies were in close approximation, and the onlookers were just witnesses to that.  It appears this was a high energy impact, but it didn’t come from as high as planes so the bodies could be less damaged.[deleted]Shame. Monty Python and The Beatles were actually good friends. Paul McCartney would make everyone stop recording during The White album to watch Flying Circus, and George Harrison took out a Mortgage on his mansion to finance “Life Of Brian” if you watch the movie you can clearly see George Harrison’s name as one of the executive producers. Man I love Monty Python and The BeatlesChill, no one says ‘warmest condolences’ because, despite the fact that you are correct, it still comes off as a strange thing to say, it is impersonal and doesn’t honor the gravity of the situation, and he’s gotten flak for it before.There is no answer. It’s just a way of giving nice/warm condolences. You don’t have to seek out what he’s really trying to say in thisTechnically, it\\'s not really improper English. This is a tweet. And the meaning is very clear.If he said that “Kobe was a nice man” you guys would be saying “you shouldn’t say nice when a person dies” stop trying to make everything negative. Yeah I’m sure the warm condolences was a joke about the fact that the helicopter exploded. Totally.../sHe used to take helicopters to every home game I’m pretty sure. It was his preferred method of travel it seems, so it was a stupid educated guess and coincidence I thinkOutside of america Kobe really isnt that famousRobin Williams made me cry. Never have I known an actor to make me laugh and cry and feel such strong emotions from so many different characters he played. Ever since I was a kid, Robin Williams was my favorite actor...Probably not, but I wasn’t accused of rape, cheating on my wife or having to pay people outside of court to keep quiet either so...Ok...not sure your point.No but CFIT (controlled flight into terrain) can and this is looking like a possible case of just that.  What a shame.  And his poor kid lost her life too, absolutely awful.No an aircraft full of fuel crashing into the earth does though.Can\\'t tell if you are being serious or not but crashing at high speeds in an aircraft full of jet fuel will indeed cause a fireHe was proven guilty?I believe so I really like that place lolI always assumed that\\'s the reward for being quick on the draw, and happy with that (unless other dude was quicker and got ghosted)I completely trust what he says. He is a Vietnam war hero. He was only one of several pilots, on one particular mission, that rescued ambushed soldiers on the ground as well as many other dangerous missions. He is well known. Edit: look up “autorotation” and do a little research. Geez.Nobody knows us like our creator.  Especially a bunch of flaccid assholes on reddit who talk shit and downvote anything that doesn\\'t fit into their politically correct clamor for internet validation and attention.  Normally I\\'m a salty bitch who goes toe to toe with people who talk shit to me but I\\'m moved by this occurrence and I understand that other people are too.  IDGAF about the people who think this is just some random tragedy, my comments are for those who believe in the Lord.  I hope that the few that do take some comfort in knowing that there\\'s someone out there who believes the same and is thinking of them.People who don\\'t like rapists being in charge would be chill.[removed]I completely read it wrong, my bad. I take my downvote back.True, people are pathetic.I\\'m glad you understood my post though.He actually apologised as part of the settlement in a non-apology wayactually you\\'re more likely to die in heliFuck your bitchassIt was a mistake[deleted][deleted][deleted]I listened to the pilots conversation with the tower from another link. It seems they lost contact with the pilot due to low altitude and even warned him he was too low for flight tracking. But it looks like it happened very fast. Multiple families impacted in the most tragic way possible. Very sad, thanks for that log, it’s interesting to sift through.Explain what he did to deserve it.They all knew they were doing uncomfortable dodgy shit, pilot was probably under pressure because he has no control of the weather, fogged in, but also has a high paying customer needing to get there. I mean its worked well for the pilots career so far ..until it doesnt.you\\'re illiterate.So he confessed to committing adultery, not rape.[deleted]Fucking hell! And much dire consequences to bootProbably, but the commenter asked why helicopters have more inherent danger than airplanes. Not specifically this incident.Compared to you???? Probably. 😆Yep. The TMZ article is pretty thorough.Gigi is the 13 year old daughter, not the oldest child who the previous commenter reported was also in the helicopiterAmazing how people like you pass judgment on someone that was never convicted.Sounds like a money grab after a consensual act. Case was dropped because the accuser refused to show up in court and then settled in a civil suit so he could move on.Without stats, I don\\'t know if you\\'re right about that - but helicopters are certainly more dangerous than fixed-wing aircraft, which are SAFER than cars, so you may be right.[deleted]Yeah I remember I cried for hours in a parking lot when I found out Michael Jackson died but I was thinking like 9/11 I think most of the country remembers where they were when that happened today was a tragedy for L.A the NBA and the families of all the victims on board that helicopter nobody deserves to go out like that.Yeah I was out at lunch with my mom at a bar and in between the x games and figure skating there was the news that Kobe was dead the bartender shut off the music and turned up ESPN and all of us sitting at the bar took a moment of silence for all the deceased but at that time they only said 5 people were on board and didn’t know his 13 year old daughter was a passenger also. Couldn’t believe it at all I though it was fake.[deleted]if that\\'s what it was about, why did she accept the settlement?Of course. I’m not questioning the ability of the pilot. On the contrary, I’m (vaguely) pointing out that maybe it could have been something mechanical.Hahah. Oh shit. Then you ARE winning. My bad. Totally should of payed attention to the amount of karma you had.  Lol. DildoDon\\'t need to.[deleted][deleted]Thank youI mean, most news channels in the US are for-profit businesses (like most things), and their revenue is based on viewership.That\\'s kind of where the strange nature of fame comes from. It\\'s because attention is money. That makes people who catch others\\' eyes into golden geese, even when they die.I’d be interested in the final reviews as well.Sure, please tell me more about the **Sikorsky** S-76B, I am very interested in hearing about it from you  (you might want to actually look at my user name or look at my history....)> The risk of structural fatigue related problems grow with age even with eddy current structure analysis.Please tell me more.  So interested.  I have only done a few SLAPs & SLEPs in engineering career.  /s.    > If you have been in a helicopter you would know they have enormous vibration compared to a conventional aircraft. LOL.  OK this is where I guess I should stop.You might, if you are an engineer, **actually look at the [data](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/. )**.    You see that uptick in speed and desperate attempt to gain altitude in the last minute ?  Add on to the fact that the pilot was not flying IFR (conditional VFR), and add on to the fact that there was weather and the fact that they lawn darted into terrain you are going to find that this had nothing to do with \\'age\\'.The S-76B is one of the safest helicopters out there.  It is just too fucking expensive for anyone other than the rich and the oil people.Airline guy, you\\'re dope. Thanks for sharing this! What a horrible tragedy... I hope people use this as a lesson to stop endangering themselves by taking helicopter rides as a means of consistent transportationI don\\'t know how accurate it is. I saw a few comments about how the helicopter crashed straight into the hill because of foggy conditions and he was flying too low. There\\'s a lot of incorrect info out there tho so who knows until the official statement is releasedSoooooo before looking into it, you are going to write a statement defending sexual assault just because he is rich and famous. Have you learned nothing about the world? He absolutely did admit she did not give him consent. He apologized profusely. Just cause he is a star you will write a statement that defends him \"just off the word of a chick\"  JesusUh, he admitted it on NATIONAL TELEVISION.they wouldnt, hence them not being named in the articleYeah the fact that I have empathy and morals and you extremely lack in both areas. Grow up.[deleted][deleted]You are pretty desperate for attention. Do you need a friend?[removed]Something so \"very common\" should have run through the pilots mind when approaching fog. I dont mean to come off rude, but come on man... Seems to me like the pilot took a risk that very commonly causes accidents, therefore Pilot is at fault. Paid with his life as well as others, truly tragic.Yeah I wasn’t saying it was right. That’s what why local news (Philadelphia) was reporting.What data? Got a source?Maybe, but the helicopter took off from Irvine.  Don\\'t know why, but if I had the option in LA, I would take the Helicopter too from there...Oh I didn’t know that. But apparently my question was worth downvoting.It’s part of the settlement. Either way, the evidence is so murky and multiple reports show her bragging about the money she got and the fact that it never went to criminal court and went to civil, really shows her agenda.The fact is that there was so much conflicting evidence, prosecutors not testifying witnesses, counterintuitive actions by the accuser, puts so much doubt in the caseHe’s not admitting that he knew it wasn’t consensual at the time. He said that he believed it to be consensual during the act but after hearing her testimony he’s acknowledging that she didn’t feel the same way as she did at the time.https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfFuck offDriving a car is unsafe.Really? Do you ride a bicycle everyday instead of a car to save the environment? Do you abstain from consuming meat? If the answer is no then you would probably use a helicopter to beat the traffic too if you had the money. Modern american convenience is wasteful af. Dont get on your high horse just because someone else is doing worsePeople are emotional off of the recent surprise death of a celebrity. Not just a celebrity, an athlete who represented us around the world. Someone millions of people rooted for.Of course that is more emotional than the environments decline which isnt a surprising news item at all.So, going back to what i said, not the time or place to make this about the environment[removed][deleted]More like just because its even harder for that specific family. Mother loses not only husband but daughter as well. Etc.Don’t be an idiot, they obviously meant it will be difficult enough for his family to lose him and his daughter and they hope there isn’t additional loss. Quit looking for things to be outraged about, live your lifeThis isn\\'t Kim Kardashian or some YouTube celebrity. This was a person famous for the hard work they put into their craft. He inspires people to do the same. He was an icon of the industry and a city. If you can\\'t relate or understand why some people are devastated then you don\\'t need to comment[deleted]I\\'m saying your president is going to remain your president, and no amount of screeching will stop it.cRiMiNaLDon’t you get tired of spouting bullshit like out all the time?Then why did you ask?Thought \"Bryant\".  \"Mamba\" is too typically silly for a German Shepherd / Australian shepherd mix that\\'s going to be probably fairly large and scary.  But I don\\'t want to perenialy have a negative pop into my head with his name.  The Matrix can frak off.Understandable. My dog’s name had no special meaning at the time, but now it’s special to me of course so I see what you’re saying.Could you not understand me?You are comparing apples and oranges.Helicopters that are tour operators operate under different rules according to FAA.  Just like commercial airlines, they have to be inspected, maintained, and flown under strict rules.Private Helicopters, like private airplanes, operate under looser rules for inspections & maintenance.  It is the same reason why Commercial Airlines have a much lower mortality rate then General Aviation airplanes...Didn’t say he was a saint.  He apologized mostly for cheating on his wife, the woman also refused to testify, and there was evidence she had sex with someone else soon after the alleged assault.Don’t bother it’s fakeAh ok thanks[deleted]That is some nice Whataboutism. Next time you rape someone, tell the jury \"but what about <unrelated rape incident>\", it will surely get you some points.You sound nice.When Bill Cosby passes you think people will just talk about how they learned something from Fat Albert? When someone dies it is the time to talk about what they truly were. Yeah, if I was going to a wake or funeral you don’t do it then, but reddit ain’t that. Warts and all is what an honest conversation about the man is about. Not this “thoughts and prayers” bullshit.[deleted]I highly doubt it.  According to the data and weather reports, they crashed *because of fog*.  There is not going to be video because if you can see the helicopter, it could have seen the terrain (and there would be no crash)Live in LA here. I know the spot where they crashed. So terribly sad.Lesson learned- for many of us. Wait for official facts to be confirmed Don’t reiterate “some expert on Twitter “.  After all ABC announced live that all four of his daughters were killed.Wish I could say the same about you>They are not a toy, or a safe mode of transportation/ sight seeing.> I am sure you understand what I meant! :)I understand what you meant.... It\\'s just that you\\'re wrong.[deleted][removed]Alright you got me there! My apologies. Let me redirect my grievance: the author of the article did not have to include tweets from Trump and Obama, kind of irrelevant. Still, don’t expect people not to downvote you when discussing politics (even if it is relevant to article).That\\'s not how that works. Jeez some people just seem determined to let Trump ruin their lives.[removed]Why else bring up how two presidents responded. Fucking clown.[deleted]“Foolish fascination”. So according to you he knowingly put her in danger, even though he’s been taking helicopters since tearing his achilles. You’re a piece of trash for even making the comment. People do what they want every die and death is a consequence, no need for your shitty two cents.You need therapy because you’re mindset is fucked, bro. Hopefully you’re not hearing that for the first time.Would you say that about someone that brought their children on a plane that happened to crash?They said 5 when it was 9, so kind of wrong.Their primary purpose is to help first responders locate an accident[deleted]Airplanes exist.Sure.  It was very random.  The off the beaten street is parallel to a major thoroughfare but has only one small retail block.  It\\'s hard to explain, suffice it to say it\\'s like a weird pocket of sparse buildings in the middle of a bustling seaside city.  We were walking from the parking lot and i literally barked, \"KB?!!!??\"  I can\\'t say that he looked thrilled and in fact when I asked him for a selfie he kind of mumbled \"real quick\" and barely leaned down into the frame.  Didn\\'t bother me that he was kind of chilly. I\\'m sympathetic to famous people these days in a way I would never have been pre-2000 in that there is really no escape for them at all. It\\'s one thing to have a bad hair day or be spun because you had a fight with your significant other and a whole other thing when that can end up on TMZ. I wouldn\\'t want to be famous for anything in the world.[removed]Agree!  But everybody is still using ABC as a source on this when they were the ones who reported that ALL of his children died onboardOh gotcha. Wow, that’s fucking eerie. ThanksPlus Kobe’s daughter’s basketball teammate and their parent.Need someone to talk to?I am aware they would have known he was in a crash.  But that he was dead? Confirmed?  That there wasn\\'t a chance he survived and maybe got thrown from the helicopter? Maybe his staff drove there and saw the wreck and decided to make a few bucks.... Awful thought.According to TMZ:> 4:30 PM PT -- L.A. weather was extremely foggy Sunday morning, and law enforcement sources tell us even LAPD air support was grounded because of it. Flight tracker data shows Kobe\\'s chopper appeared to first encounter weather issues as it was above the L.A. Zoo. It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear.> We know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA.At around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet.However, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew intohttps://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/Nah TMZ has been leaking stuff for years now. They had the Rihanna abuse injury photos within days, they had info about Michael Jackson’s death within hours. They have a rat/rats who are very good at both their jobs.Thanks, it has been a few years since it happened so I’ve had time to process it all properly, gotta make the most of our time in this world and look after the rest of our families reallyWe live in a media age where every one wants to be the first. Look at all the falsely reported celeb deaths and the social media shit storm of redacting reports. Every article I clicked said “as per TMZ” so I ignored it, until the Sheriff’s dept confirmed there was a helo crash with fatalities. Tragic.Such a terrible way to find out a loved one died. This entire event is tragic for everyone involved. Everything about this just feels wrong and badThen realized she would get thrown in jail if she went through with it.LA county just made a statement that it was 9 and that TMZ\\'s reports have been so inappropriate that they\\'re not even commentingSit your 12 year old ass downYes I’m the lead reporter. A lead reporter in telling you that when you said this dumb shit first that you were wrong since it’s updated that 9 people passed.So in your dumbass statement you literally proved a point. Instead of simply letting the police do a thorough job to actually confirm who passed and contact their families before releasing names, you bitched because “Waaa!! Why only the famous!”The police didn’t want Kobe’s name or his daughter’s name to be released. TMZ did that. So instead of finding ways to complain, understand that there’s no way police are going to jump out and release the names of everyone until they contact the families and the report is official.> masterfully eloquent tweetlol, it\\'s incredibly generic dude. \"what a great guy, died young was doing good things though\" \"I\\'m a parent so this is very sad, thoughts and prayers\".kobe dying is the least sad part of this incident, he\\'s a rapist who never faced justice.Whatever he does someone will criticize[deleted][deleted]Very smart on your part, I’m guessing you’re very well versed in EU law and think that giving away your data freely is very much worth clicking on any and all articles on the webOhh ok, I thought maybe it was something negative.Yeah I wouldn\\'t go to a celebrity\\'s hotel room at midnight to suck his dick.  Not my cup of teaThe accuser, after she was \"raped\" by Kobe, had sex with another man before submitting herself to a rape examination. Nurses found semen and public hair from both men during her examination. Prosecutors had to drop the case because they couldn\\'t prove it was Kobe, or this other man, or if a rape had even occurred. She refused to testify in her own case and sued Kobe in civil court. She was looking for a payout.Except it probably was consensual. There\\'s very little to suggest this was actual rape.Where are you getting the anal sex/rape aspect of this?That’s not on anything I’ve ever read, heard, or remembered about this case.So you’re just going to completely ignore those points? Fuck off.[deleted]We have already established that your opinion doesn\\'t matter. Man up.Wait more then a few hours/days, this is an initial shock.Sort by controversial and see how many have been removed. Now just is not the time[deleted]Go ahead. No one caresYou\\'ll be dead one day too, just relax. You\\'re here posting this news when he died, where were you last week or yesterday? You\\'re no saint, you\\'re doing no one a favor. You think you\\'re doing something good, but you\\'re only doing it to feel good about yourself and to feel important.  You\\'re what\\'s wrong with everything today.And your point?Ooooo what an astute observation, very deep. Everyone dies and so why bother with decency and respect. You’re a fucking clown.He never raped anyone you idiot, and I don\\'t have a daughter. What you say is irrelevant and invalid. Go crawl back into your cave.You seriously don’t know who Kobe Bryant is??Literally the only reason I know about this is Arma. Loved flying choppers in that.She doesn\\'t even say itYes because I\\'m sure the execs in her ear were saying, \"hey it\\'s cool take all the time you need.\"She didn\\'t even say the word.No she mixed Knicks and Lakers.Not a \"bruh\".Tbh sounds like nakers when it’s not a phone recording a tvYou know words don’t *actually* hurt, right? People make mistakes. It’s ok. Move on. The intent is what matters. Clearly there was zero intent here.Theres a hard R in Lakers? She probably conflates Knicks and Lakers.> A loss for all who looked up to him.Standing 6’-6” tall, that was nearly everyone.I know about that but what I’m saying is who is celebrating his death ?Kobe Bryant was not proven innocent of rape.  Details of the accuser\\'s identity got leaked and she then chose to settle instead.  In any case, I don\\'t think it is good to celebrate the death of anyone.  You clearly do not agree and that is fine.Uh, we’ve been shouting it for decades, but no one gave a fuck.We have a huge coward problem in our country that’s getting worse. The internet is getting more toxic. Mass shootings everywhere. These are the actions of cowardly people. Too pathetic to have a voice in their real life.A rapist is and always will be a rapist...they don’t change overtime.I mean, the \"trash\" would have sufficed.There isn’t one. There was a sexual assault case Kobe was tried for in 2003(?) but the charges were dropped.[removed]Sure man. Lots of tragedy :(I’ve read the article a hundred times. Discussed is with people. Most reasonable ones read it and the very easy to get legal documents and come away knowing he bought his way out of a rape trial. Who else do you defend?  OJ?  Aaron Hernandez?  The Stanford Swimmer?  We’re done here. I don’t have more time to spend listening to right wing creeps victim blame women.He was definitely a rapist.  That\\'s why he paid the settlement. Forensic experts claimed OJ was innocent, too.Sure. Neither are Mike Tyson, Ben Roethlisberger, or Jeffrey Epstein. The last two got off. Must be innocent. Later, victim blamer. I doubt even you believe he’s innocent.Not familiar with the term?maybe we were raised different, real men admit when they fucked up. kobe clearly doubled down and it wasnt untill he was backed into a corner before he admitted anything. yes he was an amazing basketball player, one of the greats, he did good for the community and the youth, but he wasnt perfect off the court. all the good he did is forever asterisked by this thing he didBan for the disrespect and slander of his name immediately after his deathThat the word conservatives use as a derogatory term.Helicopters are death traps.Didn\\'t know that. ThanksThat\\'s probably not the video as the weather doesn\\'t line up.Can you expand on that?[deleted]I would think it goes without saying that no sane person would want an athlete to die because they have history against their favorite team... You make it sound like you\\'re an exceptional human being for being upset despite the fact that your team lost a title to a great player.I’ve seen it all over Twitter and it made me tear up. He may have done some truly shitty things but it’s pretty clear he was a devoted dadThen we can agree to disagree. A person who has died cannot defend themselves. It doesn\\'t work well in this context but if you use your real name online and \"speak the truth\" about a dead person then you will be rightfully criticized. The person is dead. Why rub their transgressions in when they cannot respond or defend?We all make mistakes. Some greater than others. The only people you potentially hurt are the family members that have no answers. You are not a white knight.Didn\\'t even read the article, good for youAnd so am I.yup cause she had no moneyPeople aren\\'t trying to diminish his other daughters at all, but Gigi was the one that was obsessed with basketball. She wanted to be female Kobe Jr and play at Uconn. He called her \"Mambacita\". That\\'s what people mean when they talk about missing out on his daughter continuing the legacy.Said Bobby Riggs to Billie Jean King.> His daughter will never be as good as any male pro.His daughter is dead. But yes, we need to mourn for Kobe\\'s-fictional-son\\'s career and hope that the status quo never changes.You mean the rape where the woman herself wouldn’t testify to defend her claim? That rape that proved nothing?Whatever you say Karen.Ah, yes. Bring it up when he doesn\\'t have a platform to defend himself. You\\'re a piece of scum and I hope you live lonely the rest of your life[removed]Thank you! Ain\\'t nobody bringing that up!No one cares about the wnba. Women sports are lame compared to menWhy? No matter what unless she becomes so good she\\'s the first female in the NBA then she would either have to play in the WNBA or play overseas. Not remotely as groundbreaking as a son taking the league by storm. (Maybe)In the video he didn\\'t say reporters but whoever is definitely an assNah Kobe said fans would come up to him and say that. Nobody really pays attention to the WNBA, but I think his daughter could have been the one who changed that.He certainly admitted to having sex while being married with a 5 month old daughter at home. He also admitted he understands the woman didn\\'t think the sex was consensual.She said he choked her for much of the assault.“Every time I said ‘no,’ he tightened his hold around me,” she told police, according to court documents obtained by The Daily Beast.Afterward, she told cops that Bryant warned her, “[This] is just between the two, the two of us, nobody is gonna know about this, you’re not going to tell anybody.”Bryant, who was married with a 5-month-old daughter at the time, maintained that the two had consensual sex.In an interview with cops, Bryant allegedly admitted choking the woman but implied it was a sexual kink.“Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did,” his statement said.[removed]You’ve clearly got a lot of growing to do.You\\'re in your 40\\'s and act like this? Jesus christ...\"Don\\'t force that shit on me\" - dude does your phone just open the reddit posts for you? Here\\'s a whacky thought.... don\\'t like Kobe Bryant? Then don\\'t click on an post about his death. Commenting on this just proves you are immature and a troll. Reevaluate your priorities when it comes to consuming media, it will increase your mental wellbeing.I bet you are a blast to party with. You comment on an article you don\\'t care about. Yeah... Apparently you could care less. Fuck off.Was referring to all these people here calling him a rapist and stuff. Yuck... just agreeing with you.it had been basically confirmed for roughly 2 hours, and TMZ tends to be pretty reliable with celeb deaths, so I can see the reason for downvotesYes you can, change the channel. It\\'s not hard. And it\\'s DUMBSHIT. Asshole.You\\'re pathetic. Only a miserable cow would piss and moan about news coverage of a world-wide icon dying in a freak accident. God forbid no one else is considering your shitty feelings.[deleted]Of course you take this angle because you realize your original comment makes no sense.You mean “rapists” like him[removed]Just being disrespectful. Calling him a rapist and saying his death was justified.Why are you asking disingenuous questions?[deleted]doesnt prove not rape either. add in kobe lying about even having sex with the girl till he was backed into a corner and he most likely raped her becomes more andmore credible.why lie about something both involved parties agreed to?Disgusting humans? Bruh Kobe was ALLEGED to have sexual assaulted a person he had consensual sex with. Harvey Weinstein destroyed hundreds of lives. Wake up.It’s ok man. Nothing (hopefully$) will compare to 9/11[removed]Who was the \"son\" then?Not sure that an elderly rock god who has abused his body for decades having Parkinson’s is a shocking tragedy?  Hopefully he has some good years ahead.It is. I’m not even a huge basketball fan and I’m in tears. RIP to everyone who died in the crash and I pray for their familiesFuck, that’s really awful. I didn’t wanna believe it. This whole situation is messy afRight! Most people are just saying he was a rapist so who cares and he basically admitted it too sooo....I’d basically say the same if Micheal Vick died. Waste of news time.By trying to say “knickers” while flubbing and then transition to lakers.Trying to report on a major celebrity death while having a producer feeding talking points to you through an ear piece while you\\'re in the middle of speaking is not easy.It wasn\\'t on her mind lol. She clearly mistakenly started saying \"Knicks\" and realized her mistake halfway through and accidentally said something along the line of \"knickers/knakers\". It\\'s people like you that make cancel culture so ridiculous.It sounds natural to me, and I doubt that could be faked so quickly with a voice that sounds exactly the same as the anchor’s. But I could be wrong.A) I don’t watch basketball B) Way to categorize an entire gender because of some peoples views.Stay awful.I don’t think she is Ron Burgandy.Go clean your room.[deleted]I wasn\\'t talking to you, I was pointing to others how shitty you are as a human being.  Don\\'t respondIs every person accused of rape a rapist? Is every person that settles out of court guilty?Anton Yelchin died in a freak car accidentVery sorry for your loss and for some of the replies to you.Don\\'t be an ass.It’s not. Her husband announced it on his Facebook.Edit: And now confirmed by [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/live-updates/kobe-bryant-dead-helicopter-crash-4-others-calabasas-california-2020-01-26/) >> Girls\\' basketball coach Christina Mauser killed in crashChristina Mauser, a girls\\' basketball coach, died in the helicopter crash, the Costa Mesa mayor tweeted. Mauser was married to Tijuana Dogs musician Matt Mauser.\"This devastating tragedy gets worse by the hour,\" Mayor Katrina Foley tweeted. \"So much pain for so many local families.

There were nine people on board.He is telling the truth, the brother in law posted on Facebookgood to know how you would act is how everyone in the world will act during a traumatic experience. Why say anything at all?Yeah her husband made a post announcing it and asking for privacy.So sorry for your loss, heartbreaking.I\\'m really sorry mate. How was your sister connected to it?[deleted]What was her name?[removed]Is twitter down?He definitely wasn’t what you’re trying to make him out to be, you asshole. This man JUST died, along with his daughter. Their bodies are still warm. You better watch what you say. Karma will come back to bite you in the ass.Oh. Thanks. Didn\\'t realize.Imagine.. how early in the morning it was, getting that news for the family. Just got my tickets for game on Tuesday. It’s going to be a shit show. :(He knows you’ll never be in the position to fly a private helicopter>PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO ME PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO MELike a yippy little dogThere\\'s also no conclusive evidence that helicopters are more dangerous than cars because the accidents are calculated differently and there\\'s alot of variables.He is and was innocent.Yeah fake newsExcept he did neither of those things.He didn\\'t rape her though. He just fucked some idiotic messed up girl. That was a dumb move and scummy considering he was married.If Kobe was a rapist other women would have come out accusing him, like you see with other people like Clinton, Trump, Weinstein.He absolutely would have been.OJ absolutely did that though, and was an avid wife beater prior to killing his wife.Kobe did not rape that girl. That was never proven and the evidence strongly suggests that he did not.not a conviction either.In his personal statement he said no money had been paid. He was acquitted, girl was wearing underwear with multiple DNA samples from semen and examinations showed she had been with multiple men the night in question. I’d say he was acquitted.He didn’t pay her. She just didn’t want to be named and shamed publicly.She wasn\\'t going to win anyways. He just wanted it out of the press. She had a super weak case and admitted to lying to detectives about details of the night. Her story is very hard to believe.I have spoken enough in idioms and general motivation so here’s some tangible, applicable advice:(EDIT: I forgot to share but these videos have also helped me and one\\'s i care about who have endured hard times: one [on Dissatisfaction](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0) and another [on Loneliness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA&list=LLWm00ZqenmbQKOaeMDivGyA&index=38&t=25s).)**-wake up at the same time.***Use a chart in a .99 cents notebook or an app to coach when to prepare for sleep for waking up well rested.

Other sleeping aids to consider are extended-release melatonin along with lavender, camomile and valerian root (either as tea, spray or oil diffuser (careful with this if you have pets)) or Doxylamine succinate like NyQuil or Unisom (can be addicting, so use sparingly).***-follow a workout schedule and do one or three over your usual reps.***Nothing special, you’re not training to be an Olympiad, just staying healthy and it helps you sleep better. At-home routines [using calisthenics](https://youtu.be/ay15dc2cvm0) work just fine. And don’t get stuck bored in a routine of reps and sets, push yourself to do a little more each session.***-write/journal at night. If not, then read a book, listen to music or ambient sounds***I personally think clearer around twilight (dusk and dawn) or midnight. It calms me and helps decompress, reflect on the day and my thoughts and calm my brain as to sleep or wake up, ready. Along with this, mediation (even just sitting still and narrowing your thoughts down to one mantra) or stretching (yoga) can help calm your mind and relieve stress. Reading actual literature (fiction or nonfiction) has shown to have similar neurological effects. [citation needed].***-eat with purpose and record what you eat.***In short hand, just basic terms. “8oz red meat. Handful of kale. Butter garlic evoo lemon. Two jalapeños. 6oz salsa. etc, etc” This helps you keep a balanced variety of food for both pleasure and nutritional value. There’s no one-all diet plan, it’s individual to everyone and food is our energy. Take care not to fill your energy reserves with nothing but crap. Diversify your energy inputs. I highly recommend considering [the research this doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLQ63y5aTpo&t=345s) has put the work in as to recommend what nutrition our cells need to function properly and avoid toxins, or worse cancer down the line. It\\'s a cliche green smoothie but it can be delicious if balanced correctly. And you don\\'t have to use every ingredient she lists, just the basics of leafy greens, ginger, lemon, cucumber, green apple and maybe some broccoli sprouts thrown in (you can grow at home), blended with water or ice is a great alternative to loads of coffee and caffeine all day.* **-follow a daily/weekly planner and focus on attainable goals.***Again, start simple and modest. If you have a dead end job and seemingly impassable roadblocks in daily life, just bite off what you can chew. One workout the first week. One journal entry that first month. One reward for one deed done. Think of the budget that will help chew off some of that debt in a month, quarter, year.***-visualize the goal, don’t succumb to thoughts other than making it work.***Don’t allow thoughts of failure to overcome all the blessing you already have in life. I personally think back on the painful memories of either mourning a death or something trivial like being in the hospital with an injury or suffering thru the healing process of a bad sunburn. Remember how that felt, how you wish you took advantage of being physically capable and comfortable. Of how you felt like there was no-going-back to “being normal.\" Yet you overcame then and you can overcome again. Homo sapiens are a species of endurance that our hunter and gatherer ancestors would literally wear out our prey due to our sheer endurance and fortitude of patience. We have that inside our genetic material, in all of us, pro-athlete or kid down on his luck in a shit town with depressed thoughts and a defeatist mentality overshadowing the greatest within.***-be patient. chip away at the marble block that encases the true potential within you.***I know how cynical and skeptical we can be with all the self-help nonsense out there, just trying to take our money and move on to the next target. But I have had and heard nothing but positive things about [the Enneagram Personality Test.](https://www.truity.com/test/enneagram-personality-test) It has a deep and sometimes controversial history dating back to the 4th century but take what you will from it. It helped me organize my jumbled ideas of what I was and wanted to be and helped me retain focus.***-“your focus determines your reality.” If your focus is negative, you have negative results.***Don’t be afraid of who you are. Don’t allow the world to get in your way. Don’t fall into the rat race or the status-chasing on social media and end up losing yourself. Accept that there is darkness inside all of us and choose not to accept that side of you. That’s the patient battle we all have to endure that keeps us focused on reaching our potential becoming someone who will one day die, not in infamy or apathy but in grace and loving memory. Be the person your family and friends remember as a role model.  It’s all love, cuz.*It may not be much but I believe in you. You got this.Failure is our greatest teacher. I’m sorry if I’m only speaking in cliche idioms but they are cliche for a reason of their inherent truth. I truly know what you’re going through and that internal-acceptance of an existential death. I’ve attempted to ultimate decision and failed because I knew the ones that loved me would never be the same if I was dead and gone. I had to think outside of my self, my own pain, my own suffering, our “beautiful struggle”. But that’s not all. That’s not all we can give to what the world has given us. We lose focus on just how many spoils we have been gifted because we take it for granted. Despite all the failure, the heartbreak, the unfair, unjust system we have to endure, we still simply wake-up and our body keeps ticking. You are the microbiome of millions of living organisms that keep waking up and reproducing to keep your body alive. The microorganisms and cells that make up our organs, brain and thoughts, they want your body and mind to keep living. And your mind, your spirit (or what have you), wants something bigger, wants purpose and to give. **You feel the weight of failure because you know deep down there’s something still left in you.**If there wasn’t, or if you didn’t care, you wouldn’t be feeling this way. You’d be stuck in a hedonist cycle of pleasure and reward and sucking up resources and joy from others. But you’re a good person that wants to do more with your life. Debt can be consolidated and chipped away. Death teaches us to live stronger and harder in the memory of those we once loved; for their memory and honor. Being a caretaker is the most altruistic honorable deed a human can take servitude in. Shit towns cover nearly every surface of civilization, there’s no merit in pointing out the obvious averages that we all live in shitty spreads of litter across this beautiful planet.Be “the Kobe” in your shit town. Be the Kobe in your family and community as you use your energy and time to care for others. But if you need to move on, move on. They might feel hurt and confused but in the end they will be happy you have strived for something better. Something good for you and good for all. To be a true professional that strives for perfect execution of a honorable merit. There’s love in you, that’s why you care. Follow the love inside you and it will show the way. Execute! Love and be loved.Maybe that’s no longer true.[deleted]god damn got me thereHoly shit lmaoYou and a bunch of people in these comments need to be slapped outrightsure it is. someone being dead doesn\\'t mean they\\'re exempt from criticism for heinous actionsTime: 2003Place: ColoradoWe don’t know the other people, why the fuck would we talk about them?Dumb comment. If someone who’s famous dies along with 5 other non-famous people, obviously everybody is going to be talking about that one famous person. Nobody is affected/cares about people they don’t know, or don’t know of.Yeah, but TMZ is highly reliable in terms of breaking news anyhow.Ok, so there have been 18 crashes in the last 5 years. When I was there, the single pilot of our tour did upwards of 8 tours a day, 5 days a week, and that\\'s just one pilot, and they had 4 helicopters I think? which means they could hypothetically do a max of 40 tours a day, hypothetically x 365 days a year for roughly 1300 tours a year and that\\'s just a single company, and there are many islands, and many companies in Hawaii that do Heli Tours. While 18 crashes is a lot, given the number of tours, It\\'s still relatively safe.They\\'re much safer than planes when an engine is lost.  It\\'s all the other situations that make a helicopter less safe plus the issue that they\\'re trying to shake themselves apart every time it gets in the air and the crazy amount of maintenance that is required which inevitably gets missed due to human error and they\\'re just not safe.They can land without engines.No. The number of helicopter flights that are movie rescues as you describe is microscopic compared to the total.  And besides, that same skew could be applied to vehicle travel if we say that some vehicle travel is high speed chases and ambulances rushing through forest fires.  Source: actuaryThat’s what they have to do to be competitive in this modern media market.  Eyeballs go to the entity that reports FIRST.  They put out whatever “facts” they get with little fact checking because media and news is so competitive these days, if they don’t get eyeballs they go under.  The facts don’t matter, the eyeballs are what make them money.They are tabloids...The Rick fox one is now also confirmed false. You’re rightJimmy savile <> Kobe. And there was nothing new in 2016 or 2017. Unless you are talking about the academy award last year.Then wouldn’t comments praising him also be useless? It’s not like he cares about any sympathy he’s receiving right now because as you said, he’s dead.Boring argument.Not saying you’re wrong, but the Leo issue could have happened a few years prior. “At the time” might be more broad here.I clicked your profile and the first thing I saw is you posting about owning a Tesla. I believe you do live in California, and therefore you story. Thanks for sharing, would like to hear others!Can confirm. I worked in a hotel that hosted many professional sports teams. The orders they had sent to their rooms were outrageous. Stefon diggs ordered 3 orders of buffalo wings, totaling 60 wings for himself, then called back down and ordered more food 😂Edited : he’s not a lineman but still lolWhoa.... that was some story...?!  :-/is this bogus, or is it going to stay low in the thread because he seems to be a national hero..?You know nothing about the case. When she went to the hospital, they found another man’s semen on her underwear. They said there was trauma to her vagina which could have been caused from too much sex. She was known for having a history of  mental illness. A few days after their meeting, her friends said she was bragging about sleeping with Kobe and explaining his genitals to them.When police questioned Kobe, he denied having sex with the girl. Once confronted with the fact that they had found his semen, he changed his story to say that he had in fact had sex with her, but it was consensual. The case was dropped when the victim refused to testify.[removed][deleted]>He worked as an usher at Staples. Your stationary shops have ushers? I knew America was decadent but...What about the DiCaprio story?Maybe. Maybe not. You got my point, lets leave it like that. Its hard time for everyone[deleted]Okay apologize now.Gonna have to bad sports takes you. Apologize when you figure out please.Thank you :)Don’t think I’ve met another member of this club before, but yes you’re right. Peace and love to you and your family.I can\\'t imagine this feelingYou know these are your last seconds in the Life and then it\\'s all overI am sorry for your loss.[deleted]I withdraw consent for this comment. I\\'ve seen you make this a couple times.Maybe. I hope it’s wrong. The only thing officially released is that at least 3 are dead and no one survived the crash. Not even Kobe’s name bas been officially released yet, but someone probably leaked that info. When something newsworthy like this happens, it’s super common for various media outlets to report completely unverified information in an effort to break the story first.I\\'ve updated my response..TMZ. I\\'m on mobile and not sure how to link but here\\'s a copy paste Update: It is now confirmed that Kobe’s two daughter’s Natalia  17,  and Gianna 13, Bryant were among those on board the helicopter with their father.EDIT. We are reporting to fast. Now I\\'m gearing on lil y the 13yo on board.No. That\\'s the only other confirmed deathWhy do you care what other people think about a dead personThat’s high but not as high as a airplane. That’s the reason why helicopters are used for short trips/news/police. Reports are saying it was the engine or rotors which sadly means knew they were going downHighly doubtful. I’m sure you’re like “Honey, you wanna see the Kobe joke I made on Reddit? Honey?”. Stay in the basement pal.It’s tragic no matter what. But sometimes celebrities get seen as untouchable - they’re held in this surreal light, so it’s surreal when they die.Wow, you\\'re a pretty opportunistic cunt.Stop trash talking Kobe, you guys are spamming NegativeWithGold.You’re a monster. Get help.Get your commy head out of your ass. Losing people is hard regardless if it was a death in a 97 corolla or in a helicopter.Maybe you should try out what your username suggests.Yikes. Imagine being so delusional that you think millionaires aren\\'t people.Do you think it’s easier for millionaires? With the whole world watching you grieve?You\\'re* = you are. As in, I believe you are full of shit.All I did was ask for proof of your claims that he was a serial rapist and a serial adulterer. Stop trying to push false information to support your narrative.I truly hope so. Tho. TMZ confirmed his 13yr old has passedAhhh, man, I hoped it\\'s not true :( may her young soul rest in peace.I\\'m not accusing him. It\\'s funny how Obamatangs only believe the accused if it\\'s towards a liberal🤣Alright, so I checked the 7 people above you on controversial talking about his rape case, and not one of them has ever posted in any far right sub. The most common place seems to be BernieForPresident (or any of the other subs for him).The hell are you talking about? I\\'m pro Trump. That was another faceless accusation just like Kavanaugh. You people are the worstFunny because I’ve seen ~~the opposite~~ people from both sides bring it up. Just because some people are hypocrites doesn’t mean it’s not a valid thing to be upset about.[deleted]He was flying to his daughters game, it’s a tradition with him. He flies in a helicopter because he can land right at the stadium.Cause he was rich. Rich people do that kind of shit.dunno, have heard of celebs getting licenses to fly shit before.again, hope that news here are wrong.with my kids upstairs in bed, you have no idea how much i am hoping you are right and the media here are dead wrong.that’s what news here in israel are saying. hope they are wrong man...His daughter just confirmed he wasn’t on the helicopterIrresponsible news reporting. Such a horrible thing to report and have to retract.No, not to my knowledge.But the OP was saying that they always tried to imagine the last moments of the victims of plane crashes. I was saying that there are many audio files online from the black box cockpit recorders recovered from past plane crashes. I, like OP, always find myself imagining the last moments of crash victims, then I foolishly go one step further and am drawn to listen to the audio online.If there are recordings from today’s crash, they wouldn’t be released to the public until after any investigation by the TSA or any other agencies were complete.I think it’s because it’s something we greatly fear, and one way to face that fear is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of people who have gone through it.Either that, or we’re just not right in the head...Senseless paranoia.The cabin went completely dark, is there a reason why they might have turned everything off inside?I would bet you the pilots of that flight were hardly concerned. There are emergency procedures for everything aviation related and the people sitting up front are trained extensively on all of them.In an emergency decent a plane can lose 20000 feet in 3ish minutesThats about a descent rate of -7000 feet per minute, during a normal descent a plane will descend at about -1500 to -4000 fpm, depending on the approach pattern or other factorsIt was an issue with the door. As far as how long it took I’m not sure, it seemed like forever. I think from when the plane started to have issues to the time we landed it was less than 30 minutes.American Airlines. I got a 10$ meal voucher for my problems.So you could\\'ve seen a plane of civilians being shoot down and epidemic about to break as possibilities???BsWhen your parent passes away it mean more to you then when a stranger passes away. I’m more likely to talk about the death of my loved one then that of a stranger. The same thing happens here, people are talking about Kobe because that’s the person they knew and had an impact on their life even if it was just playing a game. We can all respect the deaths of everyone but that doesn’t mean we will react to each death the same way.Learn to stop white knighting and pandering and use common sense.it is real??Yeah honestly this isn\\'t that rare. People predict deaths all the time. All it takes is one correct guess out of a billion to say \"I told you so.\"I so hope it isn’t, but I’m seeing that at least one of his girls was with him. This is absolutely terribleTMZ says one has been confirmed on their site now.His poor family :-(Sincerely sorry about your mom and friend.She was also a minor who was raped in the ass by Kobe.When he dies I will insult himWay to go full misogynist, bud.Then I ask you to please consider the 4 other people (Including the pilot) in your grief aswell, their families are watching too.[removed]TMZ is the main source of news on this, they haven\\'t confirmed anything except that it was him so farWheres the source on the evidence you muppetThat\\'s literally what I said, but thanks for adding an article link I guess5 dead. One being the pilot. Hes got 4 kids.He just retweeted that news is pulling back on the info that daughters were on board.Everyone is citing ABC but no other sources[https://mobile.twitter.com/DennyBurk/status/1221525994172928001?ref\\\\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/DennyBurk/status/1221525994172928001?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)Holy shit I gotta get a bandage after encountering that edge, son.Why? I acknowledged the very real sadness that resulted from his untimely death.You’re right, it sucks no matter what. TMZ confirming his 13 year old was on boardMe too, thank god.The irony in this comment is that probably no one will cry when you dieI hate that I like thisThe blurb is 5 dead, typically the pilot is included in these incidentsEDIT: Ah I see, this is moving quick so there could be some confusing, but some are saying 5 passengersNvm people are saying ABC is wronghttps://twitter.com/tmz/status/1221533868433592320?s=21[deleted]I’m hoping it isn’t true for now.

Was my post really that badly written?I just googled it. Apparently he had his pilot\\'s licenseVarious news sites but Admittedly, I\\'m waiting for the dust to settle. fuck manHe was a man accused of something and never convicted. Innocent until proven guilty. He was a grown ass man that worked hard to get to the top of his profession. Im not saying he did or didn\\'t do it. Regardless, his death and the death of his daughter is tragic.I feel bad for the guy being so out of touch with life. It\\'s not worth your time trying to deal with this dude.Thanks for the info and the link. Since this is Reddit, I kind of halfway expected that link to be the video of Shaq \\'rapping\\' KoBe hOw My AsS tAstEOk then why didn’t he go to jail? Why was he still in the NBA?Idk man multiple reports are saying children on board. Could be true I\\'m not saying it is but I\\'ve seen a few reporters saying itConfirmed fake just now.You didn’t pay your condolences. His name is literally right there, it’s not random basketball player.That was the initial report. The update is only slightly better- he was in there with one of his daughters, not all of them.But one daughter did die. And now it\\'s up to 9 people.https://mobile.twitter.com/WPLGLocal10/status/1221525932650844161Google ABC news report. Also search on Twitter. Will post linkOmfg... sent chills down my spine.. his wife and youngest..Yes, the newspaper that has won multiple Pulitzer Prizes and one as recently as of 2017.No, it wasn’t. That wasn’t part of it ever.She did it to herself. https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape/It doesn\\'t sound like she even tried criminal court. But she was willing to go to civil court?I find it very dubious.Only one of his daughters was on the helicopterWhere was the rape trial.... Kobe has oneNot a problem brudda. I’m looking forward to his interview today with his good friend that’s a rotor wing pilot. Should be interesting. I think like most people following this, I want some answers as to the why and how it happened.Edit: here is a video of a fixed wing pilot flying VFR into IMC. Pretty cool to see how quickly and shitty the weather turns on you up there.https://youtu.be/B56DoPDd6BMAlso, there are a few doorbell cam videos of the sound of the helicopter above and then crashing. It sounds very abrupt. You should check those out.Another video regarding VFR into IMC. https://youtu.be/h402xh7kBtAdamn I never thought of thatPretty much, yes.With the speed that they were going and the fog / cloud cover, they likely never knew what would happen even in that last second. No fear, no pain. Just nothing. Time as they knew it, simply ended.True, if cost wasn\\'t a problem in the future though I would like to see something that could withstand crazy high speed crashes and keep the occupants alive. Probably will never happen as much as I want to dream and imagine.I guess what  it comes to is that crashing is bad no matter what and needs to be avoided at all cost. Should focus all our resources on accident avoidance. Implement technology that avoids collisions and assists the pilot. Maby some sort of imaging system to see through fog as well. (like this)[https://scitechdaily.com/depth-sensing-imaging-system-can-see-through-fog/](https://scitechdaily.com/depth-sensing-imaging-system-can-see-through-fog/)Would they have known there were descending?[deleted]I am shocked as well. US citizen+sports fan = fastest person to put you down if you don\\'t worship their gods, but you could probably replace that with any country+million dollar spectator hobbyBecause your knowledge of pop culture is bad lol. And you\\'re debating how famous he was even after others have told you you\\'re wrong. The UK isn\\'t the rest of the world dude.I wasn\\'t actually trying to compare the two. I was just saying I was struggling to think of any celebrity deaths SINCE  then.With that being said I do think you are underestimating how famous Kobe is. The fact that you didn\\'t know who Kobe was prior to his death doesn\\'t really help your argument because the fact is that he was famous enough to  have his death be big enough world wide news for even you (the person in a country where you say no one cares about basketball) to hear about it. This makes the argument that he\\'s not famous because you never heard of him technically not true. And now that Im thinking about it Kobe may actually have more people know who he is than John Lennon because of how famous he is in China. The sheer number of people in China makes me think it is a possibility.>I\\'m sure he is, amongst basketball fans.You say that like basketball isn\\'t one of the most popular sports in the worldHard for me to believe given how many Europeans I know who definitely know about him. Curious now where you live given that claimVideo of the crash. Hard to believe anyone was conscious when it hit the ground. Was spinning out of control[deleted]nice straw man there man. comparing an overpaid ballthrower to an actual enterpreneur who has contributed to society significantly. sure, bg has way too much money too. but yeah, not wasting my time on you anymore. its okay to have feelings, sure. its just so bizarre to mourn someone you didnt know. also, just to be clear, sure i respected kobe and other honest hard working athletes too. but i really dont care when they die. and why should i?A lot of people fly in helicopters without having a helicopter toy made of them. Like, most of them.Dude, he admitted it.It\\'s all here https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confessionWell the fact that they settled out of court speaks volumes. Weinstein did that.&#x200B;But hey I guess the guy dribbled well, so he can\\'t be a rapist right ?No, when he is proven to be innocent. Is he guilty because someone claims he is? Did Emmet Till deserve to be hung because of a baseless accusation?[removed]I appreciate that, I really do, but from a young age I’ve always saw death as the inevitable. When i die, if anyone actually shows up to my funeral I’d be surprised. And I appreciate how you aren’t jumping on me, it’s a rare thing to find someone on the internet who doesn’t have an itchy trigger finger. But if now isn’t the time for dark humour, then will there ever be a time for it? To me it’s like joking about a bad situation to calm myself or someone else though it rarely ever works on others. I suppose what I’m trying (and failing) to say is that we all have to go at some point and I’ve never seen a reason to be sad about it, kobe actually managed to do more in 1 lifetime then some could do with 5. He became rich and world renowned, he had some beautiful children and the respect of millions! Im honestly jealous, he died and already 20,000 people are giving condolences and stories about him, when someone like you and me die, who’s going to remember us? In however many years when i die, il be remembered for a few years then I’ll become an afterthought, then a memory and then forgotten completely. The only evidence that I’ll have ever lived will be a little stone tablet with my name and birthday that will be dilapidated and mossy. He’l be remembered and loved for years to come but us? Me and you? Two average (sorry for assuming) people? It’ll be like we never existed at all.Not sure how to condense the link, on mobile.

They still exist.you know when you\\'re in a new land, family is all you really got. you can make 100 friends and lose 100 friends but you only got 1 family, treasure them.I appreciate everyone’s comments - I let her know I wasn’t trying to be cold or “sterile” - simply pointing out that a lot of people die every day & nobody knows/cares.  Yes Kobe was a monster on the court & a smart guy (read that he spoke 4 languages) - also read MJ said Kobe was only guy who could give him competition 1v1 - that’s huge...albeit cause Jordan said “Kobe stole his moves”  ;)Thanks for everyone’s inputDude wtf maybe hop on over to /adviceTwitter API does not allow changing the time of post.Sounds innocent:\"This was settled out of court and included Bryant publicly apologizing to his accuser\"I knew nothing about this, but, why can\\'t people learn to live and let live, live and forgive..... Etc.It\\'s understandable to be upset that an athlete you admire died unexpectedly. Maybe consider how sexual assault victims feel seeing people put a rapist on a pedestal all over social media, and weigh the hurt that they feel compared to the pain *I\\'m* causing. It\\'s important to not let admiration keep you from seeing someone as a whole and complex person who was a great athlete and philanthropist and who also brutally sexually assaulted a 19-year-old girl.I know that. The case was thrown out. But its like the Michael Jackson crap. Even after death people want to destroy legacies. I never said he did it. All these Liberal idiots are though. 1 hour after it came out he died people were posting sick shit on Twitter that shit is sickI don’t think he did either, I’m kinda sad to see him go tbh. One of my friends loved the guy. I’m not that into sports but he seemed nice so I wish the best for his family. Don’t know why I got downvoted into shit and told to off myself by some guy but, here I am. You seem cool so I don’t really want any trouble.Helicopters don\\'t work.Yeah, if it was not a controlled crash chances are 0 in both cases...sad.has it been confirmed that it was not a \"controlled\" descent?Well, firstly, arguing and whining are two totally separate things. Secondly, I wasn’t doing either. Just expressing my viewpoint, which you’re more than entitled to do in return. If you don’t wanna discuss our disagreement, just stop responding.I’m not offended at all. I’m actually engaging in respectful, thought-provoking conversation on this comment thread. Feel free to join.Yeah I flew a month or two ago and it was the worst experience of my life, there wasn\\'t a second I was on that plane I felt comfortable until I took a few xanax, then it was cool lol.I\\'m just saying, he asked if it was correct. And there is no real correct version here. There is a traditional version of course.I love language and its usage, hence my question. I understand what his message is and am not interested in that.Fuck off RockyYeah, I think so too.Yeah, I cried a bit for Robin too. He has a lot of films I really enjoy. Recently, I revisited What Dreams May Come on bluray and dear lord it hit me at times.I think he ended up settling as she dropped the sexual charges to a civil suitHe had to issue an apology in court. I think there were all kinds of issues. Some weird sex happened in Colorado spa. The chick is not totally truthful possibly. He was a bad husband for sure.Subway has a more soft bread. That one has a french baguette style of sandwich.Give your dad some love[deleted]Keep on, what else is on your mind?Yes that\\'s .... what I saidDidn\\'t know who he was. Nor did I outside of being an american athlete who was accused of assault. I had assumed us \\'football\\' until todayIgnorant on the topic, so I asked the questionBased on the angst from my question I\\'m guessing a child and a rapist died?Cheated on his wife with a bunch of girls when he was going around America, more than likely because he has money and is famous. People that stupid shouldn’t be idolized unless the people idolizing him are shallow and just as stupid as he isThis article is in Kobe’s favor if anything.Despite of how wrong I sounded, I’m right, he raped a poor 19yr girl, there’s proof and everything.Assuming it’s a single engine helicopter. Kobe’s S-76 is dual engine. Should have been able to fly to an airport.Not a man. Thank heavens!I edited my comment. My wife was reading me fake news off Facebook and I spread it like a good Russian bot. After people questioned it I realized I should probably verify it myself. It\\'s not true.Amazing how people like you continue to support a rapist even after he admitted it publicly.[removed]I didn’t delete my post. You must have me confused with someone else.If you meant that now that’s he’s dead they’ll have to take him off the roster; he’s been retired for almost four years now. And the all-time teams contain retired and dead players. Maybe you should think deeper with your question.She filed the civil lawsuit while the criminal lawsuit was ongoing. The real question is, if he was innocent, why did he settle before the civil suit went to trial and issue a statement saying that he believed that the sex was non-consensual on her part?Thank you very much for the reply! I appreciates you taking the time to give me an answer!😊 You are great, have a wonderful day!👏🏼> A pilot at the level of flying someone like Kobe, would have an instrument rating. He is a commercial pilot.  I can\\'t imagine he would be able to get a job flying the S-76B without his Instrument and CFI rating and S-76 training (though I know the FAA doesn\\'t require it due to the weight class - Kobe\\'s insurance carrier would)It is not a question of if he was rated - it is a question of why he didn\\'t just switch to IFR.  Until we actually know the pilot and their skill level, I would not speculate on their competency.Just looked up the crash site.  949\\' above sea level.  The lowest altitude they had been at was 1200\\' and they suddenly gained 1000\\' in the last 60 seconds and seemingly stalled.  So, they didn\\'t just fly into the side of the mountain, although certainly low.The sudden gain in altitude followed by the loss of altitude and increase in speed indicates either a stall or mechanical failure.  What was the altitude of the terrain of the crash site?  If it was 2000\\' I\\'ll blame the pilot.  If it was a lot lower then I\\'m not so sure.  As I posted above this copter was owned by Bryant.  I would assume it was his regular pilot and you can google and see he made this exact flight all the time, so unless it was a sub pilot they should have known the route.  Also, there should have been 2 pilots.EDIT: Another possibility is that they were low because of air traffic restrictions and were rising there to make it over terrain while still maintaining 1000\\' AGL and either misjudged where the terrain was or when they went to gain altitude it put additional stress on a part resulting in mechanical failure.I posted the data above already.  Same link.That could be or could be that he had a loss of power and just crashed.  Do we have the ADS-B altitude tracking?Uh huh, admitted it and wasn\\'t charged?Uh huh, admitted it and wasn\\'t charged?[deleted][deleted][Data](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/)There are 2 engines on a S-76B.  They would only both fail if there was no fuel/bird strike etc.Good work - you basically just gave the definition of date rape.I’m sorry, which part of his statement was incorrect.The woman says it was non-consensual.He said he believed that she thought it was non-consensual.He BELIEVED she THOUGHT IT WAS NOT CONSENSUAL.If you have sex with someone and they believe it to be non-consensual, that is the definition of rape.Using Kobe’s OWN WORDS, tell me where I’m wrong.Or eat a dick. Consensually, of course.>\\tThe fact you can’t empathize with **OP**Empathize with OP, not Kobe. Read. And I’m not here to convince you one way or the other. That’s on you.So let’s wish that another family has to deal with it?? Why even say that? Better to just offer condolences or say nothing at all.If that’s what they meant, why did they delete their comment?Over 8 people died in that helicopter crash and all people seem to be talking about his koby and his daughter  So yeah when it comes to acting like if their lives matter more especially in this thread it comes out[removed]Based on what?Read the SDNY indictments involving \"Individual-1\" sometime. Those are felonies.Edit: Here, I\\'ll provide more context, [Direct link to the federal indictments](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/516-michael-cohen-manhattan/d85a4cc24e25b7ecf4ab/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)>During the campaign, Cohen played a central role in two similar schemes to purchase therights to stories – each from women who claimed to have had an affair with Individual-1 – so asto suppress the stories and thereby prevent them from influencing the election. With respect toboth payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohencoordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetingsand phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments. (PSR ¶ 51). In particular, andas Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination withand **at the direction of Individual-1.**Then that means *you* are the one comparing apples to oranges, because you compared the overall helicopter death rate which includes both the private and the commercial helicopters to the general aviation death rate. You’re putting apples and oranges together in a basket and then comparing them to a basket of fruit and calling it all equal.I’m questioning the helicopter death rate *amongst millionaires*.> Pilot’s prepared weather briefing would have a minimum visibility/ceiling forecast along the flight path. Because weather doesn\\'t change ?I have no idea the expertise of his pilot or why he decided to do that.  What I do know is that he didn\\'t file IFR and he most likely flew it into terrain.   Maybe they though there was a hole they could get through - have no idea. Pretty much every industry expert for Helicopters is in Anaheim or making their way there this evening for Heli-Expo.  NTSB will do their due diligence, but this one is not going to be a mystery.Yeah except he didn\\'t rape anyone. Rape \\'allegation\\' =/= rape. If it was rape she would\\'ve brought it up countless times after the metoo movement started again. I guarantee if I asked you about Kobe 24 hours ago this incident would\\'ve never come up. I swear down some people have no ounce of respect.And? What\\'s your point? Chat shit about a guy who also lost a promising daughter, get banged.Shut the fuck up, Cosby raped multiple women and unlike Kobe, didn’t get acquitted.Fair enough I didn\\'t realise my comment came across that way. Sorry for calling you a piece of shit and an asshole I\\'ll delete my original post if it sounds like I\\'m being criticalI guess that is what happened.  They were too low, in the fog, and hit the hillside.  No one in the helicopter probably knew.True enoughWow, what a see you next Tuesday haha Your original comment doesn\\'t even make sense as an analogy and you should be embarrassed.How am I wrong? I mean I know reddit filled to the brim with trash so I don\\'t question why you are being a dick, but I have to know - why do you think a helicopter is safe? and why do you think someone saying they aren\\'t is a comment on cars? You clearly already deserve to be told to fuck off but i am curious.edit: hey bro, could you respond faster? I have a bunch of data to copy paste and I dont want to wait around. Fuck it, I\\'ll add it to my original comment. Go read it, You don\\'t get to say I am wrong, sorry.you brought up cars? they are literally 30 times less dangerous.Who hurt you>love easy points*Looks at current score*What the actual fuck are you talking about?So it’s *my* fault for commenting on part of the article. Yeah, okay.And you also seem to care enough to reply 10 hours later so...Why does everyone keep insisting I hate trump? I never said that. I never even alluded to that.Who hurt youThen fox5 should not have included President 44 & 45’s tweets in the article if you don’t want people pointing out the differences between the two.MAYBE because I find it intriguing how the two carry themselves in different ways and because it was in the goddamn article.Don\\'t bother responding. BLOCKED.[deleted][deleted]They got it mostly right. ;)Honestly, I don\\'t know why you would risk it.  I am now retired and only fly with family for general aviation so I would never risk my spouse or my children that way.  My work career was only with experience professional test pilots who I never saw take a risk they didn\\'t have to.  Most people point to arrogance, complacency, get there ites etc...Basically it is just a sad mistake that cost people their life.How high do you think the helicopter was lolThanks, very cool :)I\\'m still confused why he was hanging out alone. seems dodgy hahaAnd then they bitch about how gullible people are with fake news, it’s so frustrating to observejesus christ...Apparently it took over an hour to put the flames out because of how much magnesium was ignited in the crash. No chance someone survives thatI live in Woodland Hills. People don\\'t realize there are actual mountains in LA and that corridor of the 101 where the crash happened winds thru some pretty significant hills or mountains and I can imagine the pilot being caught totally off guards with the visibility issues. Also this week had some warmer than average days while the nights are always cool causing a heavier inversion layer than usual in the area.I see. Thank youI can’t think of a time where TMZ was wrong about a celebrity death. I actually remember when Michael Jackson died, a friend of mine called me to tell me and she said only TMZ is reporting it. And I said “then it’s true. They always get this stuff right”Absolutely devastating. I have family currently serving in Iraq and I am terrified I’ll see his face on a news site whilst at work. My worst nightmare[deleted]Yes yes.. nobody else knows who else was flying in a helicopter with Kobe Bryant when it crashed. He just lets anyone hang out with him on private flights. The names will never be released becausenobody gives a shit. At least KOBE BRYANT graced the world with his presence. The rest? Who cares.[deleted][deleted]>because clearly the first thing a rape victim does it go have more sex.I guess it\\'s easy to slut shame a rape victim when you like the person who attacked her because he can throw balls through nets really well. Or could, before he died.Nah u have nothing to apologise for. I was in the wrongThey had her blood on kobe\\'s shirt.>She refused to testify in her own case and sued Kobe in civil courtNot testifying in the criminal trial was most likely part of the deal to settle the civil trial.Your blaming a poor 19 yr old for taking what little justice she can get against a millionaire abuser and his team of lawyers.Classy.the girl had bruises on her neck consistent with her story. Was bleeding from the incident. told her coworker directly after the incident she was raped.  oh and he admittedly that he could see why she thought it wasn’t consensual but sure little to suggest it.Ignore what points? That he admitted he choked and raped her in the ass? Fuck off. Sorry your homo love affair with a basketball player is over.Kobe admitted to having non consensual sex with her after he lied to the police. Your hero is a cheater and a rapist who died flying a private helicopter because he didn’t want to spend an extra hour in traffic.Watch the Aaron Hernandez documentary. You’ll understand how damaging your outdated way of thinking isNah I mean the one where he said he understands she didn’t consent lmaoThe person he raped does.pos rapist dies, I make a joke and everyone loses their minds! glhf.What did she say then? It sounds like she dropped the n-bomb. Obviously accidentally, I don’t hold it against her and I don’t think she’s racist for it, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find it funny.Are you her PR guy or something? Or did I link a different video?Have you though?Yeah, a really brave guy rapes someone in his hotel room.> they don’t change overtimePeople don\\'t change over time? That\\'s just blatantly falseMaybe, but not really the point I was trying to make.[deleted]Because she wasn’t raped. She had sex with multiple men that night.Found the guy who wanted another young black man in prison despite the DA’s case being too weak to even bring to trial!> maybe we were raised different, real men admit when they fucked up. kobe clearly doubled down and it wasnt untill he was backed into a corner before he admitted anything.Huh? He admitted pretty quickly that he had an encounter with her. What the fuck are you talking about? Lol. I don’t give a flying fuck how you were raised, I’mSaying most human beings would do exactly what Kobe did.> yes he was an amazing basketball player, one of the greats, he did good for the community and the youth, but he wasnt perfect off the court. all the good he did is forever asterisked by this thing he didBut People like you are weird as hell. There’s tons and tons of evidence he didn’t rape her. In what world is it safe to label someone a rapist despite evidence pointing the opposite?Not really slander. He was just asking.looks like his comment was removed though. good call I guessAre you brain dead to even do a google searchNo I make i claims for myself.My point is that it transcends those things, which I did an exceptionally poor job of expressing.[removed]Did someone say they were? I didn\\'t read it as that at all.It\\'s positive and wonderful that he has children and his wife isn\\'t alone.But they will all have to carry the loss whicb is sad.He called her that?I thought I was done crying tonight..Im just saying it makes sense that he’d prefer a son. A son would have a higher ceiling in regards to basketball. Just the way it is.By “the status quo” what do you mean exactly? Female athletes loading themselves with testosterone from a young age to develop a male body type? Until then they’re not going to be on an even playing field.Are we seriously talking about the same incident? The same one where KB admitted to having violent choking sex with someone he just met and that he could \"understand how she feels that she did not consent to the encounter\". The same case where the victim\\'s blood was found in his shirt, and her rape kit concluded that non-consensual sexual violence had occurred. The one where the girl\\'s name was leaked to the media and she was threatened and maligned for weeks? And finally, the one where he settled with her (though she didn\\'t need it because she\\'s from an extremely wealthy family) for an undisclosed amount? Seriously, you think he\\'s the victim here? OKAYYoooo what the fuck? I don\\'t know shit about Kobe or his alleged crime, but dead people are NOT immune to criticism. Are they also immune to praise? **Cuz this criticism is only in response to that praise.** Why is one okay and not the other? Get your shit together my man.Does the truth bother you that much?I think it\\'s just a traditional culture for those who believe sons can take after the fatherIt just hit me like a ton of  bricks that she died. I thought \"she will make him proud\" and then remembered she died. Ugh... such a needless tragedy.You forgot to mention that he also paid her off as to not take the case to court.[removed][deleted]i thought and was hoping so, but it\\'s reddit, so i wanted to make sure.”basically confirmed” haha what the fuck does that even mean? Do you hear how stupid that sounds? “pretty reliable”? OkNope.  The public judged Clinton and should judge him for having zero restraint.I didn’t have an original comment?Sometimes I wonder how part of humanity came to justify deaths, death is death, justified or notI thought it was a pretty ingenouous question.Why didn\\'t she testify then?Innocent until proven guilty.  That\\'s how the law works hereThere’s a time and a place for everything, man. This is not it.You must be newTo. Defend. Yourself. Do. Not. Talk. To. Police. Ever.Elaborate on how Harvey ruined hundreds of lives and source it. Kobe settled out of court for raping a 19 year old girl.imagine comparing a guy that\\'s completely irrelevant to your life to a close friend lmao how lonely are youHey bud, not sure if it matters, we all reviewed footage and saw it was actually his new daughter. Theres also footage of him at the Iris Fountain with her that night on local news. At least there is peace knowing he spent his final night with his family.Could\\'ve been a family friend\\'s son, a family member, I\\'m not sure really. Or maybe it was a fan\\'s son following him. I only saw him for a few seconds, I was at work.True that. The man might as well be immortal at this point.I\\'m not a huge fan of basketball. But I frequently read how he was a genuinely good person and devoted family man. Anytime you lose someone like that, NBA star or Average Joe, it\\'s a painful loss.Yeah I saw that. It was actually Knicks, not knickers, and I agree that makes sense.So you\\'re saying the producer was just repeating the n-word in her ear the whole time?When was the last time you tripped over your words and the n-word popped out?Yeah well she just apologized on twitter so it was indeed real. Just sounded fake to me because of that pause, but she was probably just trying to remember the name of the team and got them mixed up.not guilty 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️Oh fuck yourself, mate.[deleted]Very sad all aroundShe coached his girls basketball team the black mambas. I am trying to get my heart to stop racing and drive down and see my brother and law and her 3 kids. Thanks for the condolences.I heard about the news and then text her and when I saw my texts as green, my heart sank.I am dead serious her name is Christina check Kobe’s Instagram she coached his girl’s team. I don’t want to want the press to hear it from me. I am letting my brother in law release it when he’s ready.[deleted]I can\\'t wrap my head around it.  I would be out of my mind with grief.>Except he did neither of those things.From his statement, >\"I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not.\"You can\\'t have a consensus by yourself... [And the settlement:](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession) >The accuser’s civil suit against Bryant was ultimately settled in March 2005, and terms of the settlement were undisclosed (the total amount civil juries in Colorado could award at the time was $2.5 million).Sorry to be the one to break it to you.Who says he raped more than one person? Not all murderers are serial killers, for example. I’m not sure you really have much of an argument thereIf you stuck with reading about this case in the news months after it happened I think you may not be so confident in your assertation.  Many believe that consensual sex may have turned to something nonconsensual when vaginal sex turned to anal sex and he was slow to comply to requests to stop.  Google it.  This was not a situation about a girl making shit up.> That was never proven and the evidence strongly suggests that he did not.She had significant vaginal trauma, including bruising and lacerations. I don\\'t know what happened either, but to say that the evidence strongly suggests one thing over the other is laughable.RapsFan420 has spoken, case closedWell that’s a bold lie. You’re gonna need to show me when she admitted to lying to detectives. [All accounts of this pointed towards non consensual sex](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession)This one stood out to me> [The nurse] stated that the injuries were consistent with penetrating genital trauma. That it’s not consistent with consensual sex.”* So they had semen* He admitted to sex* The had bruise marks* lacerations to the vaginal area. “Too many to count”Don’t mix the facts up, Kobe was in deep trouble. With all of that along with her testimony, he would’ve gone to jail. Which is why his defense team went after her directly, basically to the point of intimidation:* Went after the accuser’s sexual history* Dug into her mental history, including a past suicide attempt* the fact she was “excited to meet him”* the girl was [receiving death threats](https://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/08/21/threat.bryant/)Of course she didn’t testify with all that lol. She was getting run through the mudExcept for the part where Kobe admitted it.My credit is too poor to consolidate, I\\'ll never be out from under it, and my town isn\\'t a place you can help anyone.... I\\'m just sick of it...Yes, I am certain that those in the hereafter are deeply concerned about a trailer trash retail clerk in the middle of nowhere whom they have no connection to...Right I\\'m just a retail drone with no friends or life who only eats four meals a weekDo as I say not as I doYou probably defended R.Kelly.But it doesn\\'t mean you insult them the minute they die, he also was never proven guilty he MIGHT have done it.I think that’s literally his point, guy. The only thing I know about Kobe is that people say his name when they throw things, his death doesn’t affect me but I know it affects others, the death of anyone is a solemn thing. But if the media will only mention the other people who died as “other passengers” it’s pretty disrespectful to them. Not being famous however will delay the time it takes to verify identities though, so I understand that may be an issue too.But saying that the deaths of other people you might now now doesn’t affect anyone is disrespectful to them as well as those close to themMan, math is so convenient when you can just make up half the numbers.[deleted]Most of the crashes aren\\'t in daily commutesNot so much just rescues but the fact that most jobs in the helicopter industry are close to ground or mountainous terrain. Don’t need to be rescuing someone to be in that (more) dangerous place than planes usually are.The local ABC, NBC, and CBS stations are tabloids?I dont recall what year it was posted about on reddit but I\\'d not heard of the guy until all the posts and memes about him being a rapist came about  only recently found out he did basketball. Last I heard he was a monster now hes mourned. Wondering what changed.Sure, equally useless.Spoken like someone who truly has no legitimate way to back up what they\\'re saying. Don\\'t give up so easily.It’s going to get buried and never brought up.Remember that shit? The world seems to have forgotten along the way to facilitating Bryant’s total public rehabilitation. On the night of July 1, 2003, Bryant choked a 19-year-old employee of the Eagle, Colorado hotel where he was staying (hard enough to leave bruises on her neck), bent her over a chair, and drew blood during the ensuing sex act. By the end of the night, she’d told a coworker that Bryant had forced himself on her; by the end of the next day he’d been contacted by local police. During the resulting criminal investigation, Bryant did not deny the encounter; he didn’t deny choking her; he even admitted he’d never asked for her consent, claiming to have inferred it from her body language. When it was all over—that is, after Bryant’s lawyers intimidated the woman out of the courtroom by reframing the forensic evidence to suggest that she was a lying slut—he even apologized for it. He settled a civil suit outside after him and his lawyers bullied a 19 year old into not testifying in a Criminal case. Fuck Kobe.Just curious, why would you ask this?Kobe gets a moderately bad rap, totally justified to mention that he was down to earth and genuine.Staples Center, arena where the Lakers play.He would be in the VIP lounge where there was bottle service and be standing on the tables drunk and screaming.  I hated his guts for years for being such a spoiled douche (I think Wolf of Wall Street was very much something he drew from personal experience).  I’ve since softened as I wonder how fame and fortune for someone so young would effect anyone.  And his body of work is quite astounding.Is he not a pedo rapist? I guess its okay if youre 6\\'8\", can jump high and can put a ball in a hoop.  I\\'m likely getting downvoted to hell and back by people who have zero tolerance for that shit otherwise.Yours as wellThat\\'s the worst part, just thinking about the horror he was experiencing in his final moments.  I still panic every time I hear a helicopter or see one on TV or movies.  (They always blow up.)What about it? Did she consent to sex with those men? Then what does it matter?Because with Kobe, he seemed to think sexual consent meant consenting to violence, and that is where it becomes rape. Consenting to sex is not the same as consenting to physical violence. If I consent to sex am I consenting to be chocked/strangled? No. Am I consenting to bodily harm? No. If I am withdrawing consent, or things have moved beyond what was consented to, that is rape. The minute he put his hands around her neck he made her a victim, and created a scenario where she had every reason to feel afraid of him.He made it clear that he did choke her. He admitted to that. He said her body language was her consent. NO KOBE. WTF? That is just sexual assault causing bodily harm. If you\\'re going to consensually choke someone that\\'s more than just a discussion. It is certainly not being ok\\'d with body language. You\\'re a fucking idiot of the highest degree if you don\\'t get it in writing that they want to be choked. If they die while being choked (which happens for all kinds of reasons beyond strangulation), having their written consent is the difference between a murder charge and manslaughter. What he did - the brusises he left on her neck - goes way beyond what is normal, even within that kink community.Here are some easy rules about consent. Is your sexual partner in pain and/or looks to be having a bad time? Have they told you that they specifically enjoy pain, what limits they have, established a safe word, and feel safe with you? No to any one of those? Then stop. Check on them. Call it a night. Have a shower, jerk/jill off, and get some sleep. Don\\'t be a rapist. Simple.Oh ok so it\\'s not to anyone who knows they\\'re human and eventually die like everyone else. Also prone to accidental death\\'s like everyone else.From my experience only white trash call people cunts.While you\\'re at it, write into MSNBC about the news woman referring to him as the N word, since you love him so much.Another idiot, I obviously meant it\\'s less hard because she has kids and won\\'t go into financial poverty because she\\'s a millionaire. If you people didn\\'t understand that, you\\'re morons..So average persons loses half of her income due to husband\\'s death. Has no time to take off work to get passed it, works doublely as hard or her and her kids will be homeless, remaining kids get neglected by default because Mom has to work 2 jobs, which also leaves them in danger being left alone. Vs a millionaire who never has to work again and her kids will always be well off. Big difference dumb asses HUGE DIFFERENCE.No to you it\\'s EXACTLY THE SAMEWhat\\'s that some silly way of telling me to die? Edgy. You people are proving my point which isn\\'t hard to do, keep it coming.[removed]Ask his wifeI just saw that. Those poor kids. Lost their Dad in a flash.> ObamatangsJfc what a despicable human you are[deleted][deleted]Oh my God his poor wife.I’m Greek, I’ve read all the classics.Should this be true this is an utter tragedy...the true definition of it.Thank fuck! I\\'m an Aussie and a gamer with little basketball knowledge but I have been following Rick Fox\\'s journey through the ranks of League of Legends and if that man had died before reaching Silver I would ball my eyes out. He recently did a 24 hour stream to raise funds for the Bahamas.Yeah - tho TMZ has confirmed that his 13 year old daughter was also on the flight and has died.Ah thank youThats what i find weird. Your plane definitely lost cabin pressure but i highly doubt it lost power, that would assume a dual engine failure out of the blue which hasnt happened more than a handful of times in aviation history.Maybe to prevent nausea from passengers as being in the dark would make it a little easier to process large angles of attack. Either way the airplane would have straight up oversped if they did not have complete control of the descent.When a plane loses power like this does it go silent? Like do the turbines completely stop spinning?I ask because my heart jumps when I hear the captain\\'s throttle down mid-air, hearing them go silent would be so terrifyingYes, actually. 1. It’s Iran 2. Look up videos of Chinese eating live animals like rats. It was only a matter of time before an outbreak.It\\'s hard to respect someone considering their pastOne daughter of his is unfortunately confirmed. The report about four of them is false.Ugh.  Life sucksJust horrible.19 is not a minorKobe was the pilot.It IS the local ABC affiliate to be fair. Not ABC News the network.Youre still gross and you know it.His original statement was that all four of his kids, and his wife were on the plane. He edited his, I didn\\'t edit mine.what’s the name of the person he raped? can you tell me that without having to google it first? you only care about this guy because he could throw a basketball. where was your compassion when he was committing sex crimes?oh, i got a -20 downvote and took it as a defense, sorryPaying your accuser money to keep quiet and drop the case usually isn\\'t the sign of an innocent man. Does really suck about his daughter though. Maybe the dude should\\'ve used cars to get around instead of a helicopter, especially considering how bad shape the environment is in. This dude use to use his helicopter to get from Newport Beach to the Staples Center. What kind of asshole does that? Everyone on reddit bemoans how the rich get away with everything, destroy the environment with unnecessary luxuries such as private flights, and how they can even get away with stuff like rape and murder because of their money, but when one of those types of people dies all of sudden they\\'re revered. It makes no sense, the public overall are all just braindead lemmings tbh.Because he smeared his 19 year old accuser to the point of emotional exhaustion for months and she settled out of court for a public apology, not for money which I bring up because otherwise you might assume she was just after money. She wasn\\'t, she was a kid who was raped bloody and he was a rich man with a PR team.Now everyone is saying one daughter.[deleted]I’m seeing reports that ABC is now pulling back on that claim. Smh. Lazy and irresponsible journalism.Worst possible scenario. I can’t imagine the pain his wife is feeling if it’s true.[deleted]https://youtu.be/B56DoPDd6BMMost likely, but it kind of seems like the helicopter lost balance out of the turn and accelerated downward. That would have felt a little strange? Idk, we\\'ll never know, obviously, but if they detected something was wrong it sure wasn\\'t for very long, at all. Like seconds or split seconds.Cost, weight, aerodynamics all play a big part, and not just in aviation, in every industry. You\\'ll never be able to make a commercially viable product that is 100% safe for all humans to use, because a lot of them are really dumb or too ignorant to care about the consequences.I like where your mind is going but there\\'s a big issue with certain incident avoidance systems and Boeing right now, so over reliance on technology isn\\'t the answer in many cases and can lead to more deaths. It all comes down to training and proficiency of the human in charge. Complacency is a killer in many industries and not just aviation.[removed][removed]My pop culture knowledge is ok, but my sports knowledge is clearly lacking. Just saying that John Lennon was more popular and well known than Bryant, that\\'s what started this all.There are basketball fans here sure, and im sure they grieved for him and his poor daughter. But the average person on the street didn\\'t know him. I\\'m sure you are right about China and Kobi fans, as they were in such a bad place during the beatles era that they simply were not open to western culture. According to this article the only time the beatles were shown there was at Lennons death, when it was broadcast on all 5 million (lol) of the TV\\'s in the whole of china at the time. How things change eh?https://www.upi.com/Archives/1980/12/15/Millions-of-Chinese-heard-about-the-Beatles-for-the/9199345704400/But yeah, at 40 i am not as in touch with pop culture as i was, and neither are most of the people i know. I\\'m sure the youth wearing his trainers have a better idea of who he is.It really isn\\'t that popular over here. Sorry.London based. Just not a basketball fan.Fake news: https://www.google.com/amp/s/fox13now.com/2020/01/27/fake-video-claiming-to-show-footage-of-kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-prompts-online-outrage/amp/You should do some research.https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfOnly someone capable or true empathy and sympathy would or should care.  So, we finally agree, you shouldn\\'t care.So? A lot of people aren\\'t *notorious* for traveling in a helicopter or even own a helicopter.He said that he understands that she may not have thought it was consensual, but even then he stands by that he thought it was. That is hardly an admission of rape.He didn\\'t admit to rape. He admitted to cheating... which no one is disputing.Sometimes they just want it done with and not risk court. Out of court settlements don\\'t prove guilt.Weinstein is going to court. No settlement is happening. The fact that she was willing to says something. But hey, I guess if a white woman says something happened it must have right? Guess Emmett Till got what he deserved 😏That\\'s not the only reason they defend him. The case itself was questionable. Doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t happen... but it was far from open and shut for the prosecution. The only thing anyone knows for sure is that he cheated on his wife and that he should have never been in that room. Everything that happened after that is debatable. If she was raped, then that\\'s obviously a terrible thing and he was wrong...unequivocally.  If she set him up, then it\\'s awful that he fell for it and that his legacy was tarnished, even now, over a lie. That\\'s all anyone can really say because no one knows anything for sure. So leave it at that. You don\\'t have to like the man. But his death and the death of everyone else on board was a tragedy.

Weird prediction based on seeing that Kobe was taking helicopter flights for trivial reasons like taking a friend to the doctors.Mike Beasley (@MikeBeas) Tweeted:This was not that. It seems to have been posted in response to a new story from the same day: https://t.co/n46w84vj7E https://twitter.com/MikeBeas/status/1221585710974742528?s=20Honestly, what did you want to achieve by telling her that? It’s like if she said “I’m hungry, I need to eat” and then you would proceed to tell her that there are so many hungry children in Africa. Her: “???”Your comment wasn’t simply pointing things out. Do you think she’s an idiot? Everybody knows that a lot of people die everyday or that some people get hungry too.  You were being dismissive of her, and you need to face that about yourself before you can be an emotionally available boyfriend.\"Live and let live\" doesn\\'t apply to sexual assault- that kind of mindset turns something horrible into a non-issue, full stop.The fact that you keep replying defensively speaks volumes. This one person *allegedly* assaulted can take a backseat to him today. People like you who think there\\'s some need for it to be mentioned forever are just kidding themselves.I don’t think anything is confirmed. The info I saw was from tmz, and I’m sure preliminary. But somehow they had info on what happened.the hit a mountain at an altitude of 1700 ft in heavy fog going 200 mph according to the flight data. dont think it was controlled.Your comments lacked any respect hence a “fuck off” is warranted as is the negative response to your shitty gate keeping comment.I hate flying too.  Just the thought that I’m thousands of feet above the ground gives me so much anxiety.Yeah I know, it’s a treat for me when I have those. We have a subway on every corner sometimes there’s subways across the street from subways so you can say I’ve had my fair share I’m in Canada btw. Another thing I really like is getting a portuguese cachorro quent. Never had one like in Portugalhttps://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21289/if-a-helicopters-tail-rotor-fails-is-it-possible-to-perform-an-emergency-landihttps://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/helicopter_flying_handbook/media/hfh_ch11.pdfI copy and pasted what he wrote. You can do a little research and see for yourself that it’s possible. He flew in life and death situations. I trust what he says. He’s not somebody that makes shit up.[deleted]you seem to be ignorant in general...So you would murder someone for cheating on their wife and being famous?no you\\'re wrongOh thank god. At least we dont share that in common. 👍Wow, so admitting you had sex with someone is now admitting rape? You are seriously fucking delusional. You really should read about the case before accusing a dead man of being a rapist. Thats pretty fucking low.So the accuser claims rape, then refuses to testify in court. Money grab. I\\'m not even a basketball fan, but you can\\'t go around calling someone a rapist without evidence or a guilty verdict.because it\\'s usually better to settle than go through with a long and expensive lawsuit>  Also, there should have been 2 pilots.You do not need 2 pilots for the S-76B to fly it.  >  If it was 2000\\' I\\'ll blame the pilot. According to the reports, they were flying Special VFR - meaning the pilot was allowed to go VFR until he couldn\\'t and then was suppose to switch over to IFR.  The data also shows him jumping up and down in altitude.   Most speculate from that he was skud running, but they had passengers so he could have been showing the sites too.  Being at that low of an altitude does not point to the pilot always- but it does give the pilot very few options if something goes wrong> The sudden gain in altitude followed by the loss of altitude and increase in speed indicates either a stall or mechanical failure.He has two engines.  The only real way to stall both engines at the same time would be to run out of fuel or get bird strike.  He was talking to the tower and would have said something.   He is not going to stall the engines at that velocity and climb rate.  He was following 101 - everyone\\'s favorite version of IFR (I follow Roads).  If you look at the path they were [turning](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N72EX/history/20200126/1708Z) right at the 45 min mark.   Most likely explanation given the data is that he trying to shoot through holes, wait for the fog to burn off, and got caught, turned around and was going to fast and was too low.  Could it be something else ?  Of course - a helicopter is thousands of parts that are all just eager to break.  However, the S-76B is a VIP aircraft and has a great safety record.You posted it 11 minutes agoI posted it an hour agoI was in the Helicopter Industry (Specifically Sikorsky) for over 20 years.   Helicopters fail because of pilot error.  Helicopters fail due to maintenance error.  Helicopters fail because fucking part suppliers make the parts out of spec and cause you to go to more funerals in a week then some people go in a lifetime.  Helicopters fail due to metal fatigue - specifically the gearbox.  It is an impossible request  - a box under high stress that has welds and it needs oil in the box to run.   Helicopter fail due control cables being frayed and shitty maintenance or shitty design make it impossible to checkHelicopters fail because someone leaves FOD due to error or laziness.However, just being \\'old\\' isn\\'t the culprit.The President of the United States flies in a helicopter that was designed and built in the 60s.  The loads for that aircraft were designed using 9 manuevers and all done by pencil.Honestly everything you said makes perfect sense. You\\'re probably right that they were flying low because the helicopter was failingYou realize you can go read his statement for yourself.  Dumb, dumbThe fact that you have the audacity to troll on a post of someone dying proves both my points. You have no life. Grow the fuck up.[deleted]Did you even open the link?Again, fuck off[deleted][deleted]The way it is.[deleted]> I’m questioning the helicopter death rate amongst millionaires.Actually your question was comparing millionaires to \\'general population\\' but you equated \\'general population\\' to tourist helicopters.Anyone who operates a tourist helicopter is a commercial helicopter.  Anyone who owns a helicopter for private use is GA> I’m questioning the helicopter death rate amongst millionaires.I have no fucking clue.  They don\\'t have a little asterisk next to the name saying they are rich.   I have more than one buddy who own a helicopter.  Are they rich ? no.  They just happen to work in helicopters for a living and this is their version of a classic car.  The GA deaths per flight hour for helicopters is about 1.5hrs more than airplanes.  There are about 200k GA airplanes to 10k GA helicopters.That will skew the data a little bit since there are far fewer helicopters.> apples to orangesBut you can still compare them.Can you translate this into laymen for me? What happened to Kobe? pilot error?A lack of formal jurisdiction does not mean he didn\\'t rape anyone either, it just means we\\'re not entirely sure. Rape victims do not keep bringing up them being raped 24/7. If we\\'re using anecdotes, then someone always talks about that case, particularly how he self-admittedly cheated on his wife.He wasn’t acquittedEmbarrassed by you, that\\'s ok. You\\'ll be fine.Every single thing we do every day involves risk.  If we were to eliminate every thing in our lives that involve risk, there would be very little to do.  We are probably safest in our homes as long as we aren\\'t on a ladder or in a bathtub.  Driving a car involves risk, walking down the street involves risk. To mitigate these risks, we apply rules and regulations. We now have seatbelts and helmets. We have the FAA requiring aircraft to be maintained and flight-worthy. We have GFCI in our homes, traffic signals on the streets.  To eliminate something because there\\'s risk involved is ludicrous. You are free to agree to disagree. I realize that I may have been a little sarcastic/passive aggressive, but being labeled as a bad person or being told that I deserve to be told to fuck off kind of makes you seem a little uptight. Perhaps you should go for a drive to relax a little.  Don\\'t forget to buckle-up.[deleted]Didn’t say it was your fault—it’s not your fault. I said don’t expect people to receive anything regarding politics in a positive manner.Ignore them and take it easy, life is too short to care about what they thinkPosting two people sending their condolences is one thing. Pointing out how one president is clearly more articulate than the other is ridiculously crass given the circumstance.I can understand thinking that but it\\'s a weird place to be saying it. People are showing their respects in this comment section and you\\'re using it as a way to bash the presidentGo to one of those liberal circle jerk subs if you want upvotes for your observation lmaoOh shitI’ve never watched an entire basketball game in my entire life, could care less about the sport or him as a celebrity. He was a human being. The problem is you saying he had her with him on purpose as so she would die to,. Ignorance at its finest or just plainly an asshole with no empathy.I can\\'t argue with that second part, but I think it\\'s easy to believe a bad thing will never happen to you. No one knowingly gets in their car with their family before they slip on ice and hit a tree and all die.Yet still much more safe than driving a car soo..... Did you want him to take an a private jet flight to practice?Hmmm. ok. I don\\'t know what\\'s dodgy about it, though. He lives 5 minutes from the place and he has a car and knows how to drive.  Famous people don\\'t always have a posse with them to go run an errand in their hometown.  They are just people who need manicures and run out of milk, get petrol...in fact, he probably patronized that nail salon BECAUSE it was so isolated.I used to have total trust in TMZ, but it seems like they really tanked in quality a while ago, to my great disappointment. Seemed to decide to target a different audience, and to go to extremes in \"taking sides\" in conflicts that went well beyond a reasonable favoritism towards their source. But it does seem that they have preserved their reputation when it comes to death notifications...good for them, I guess?  They have been wrong at times though--Maya Angelou comes to mind, and I think there were a few others, because I remember people acting like TMZ was obviously trash, and thinking it was absurd given its general accuracy. TMZ\\'s strength was knowing where to look for information and how to cross-check it. I\\'m sure they looked at the identification number of the helicopter and had Kobe\\'s on file.And stop trying to be an edgy little shit who thinks people don’t matter just because they’re famous.who cares? he\\'s a dead rapist, there\\'s nothing worth discussing or caring about more than any other other innumerable tragedies that happen to innocent people every day. why is this one more important?I know if he says something or doesn’t say something people will criticize[deleted]It\\'s possible to bleed during consensual sex. > Your blaming a poor 19 yr old for taking what little justice she can get against a millionaire abuser and his team of lawyers.There\\'s no hard proof it was Kobe. If this poor sweet little 19 year old girl was seeking justice, why did she bow out of of the criminal case? Apparently money is more important to her than seeing her \"rapist\" punished by serving actual time in prison. Classy.She bragged to friends about sleeping with Kobe days after. Had another dude\\'s cum in her panties when she went to get checked out the next day. None of her other coworkers thought anything had happened and she seemed normal. She was schizophrenic. She admitted to lying about details of the incident.You ignored:the girl changed her story multiple timesbragged about the money she was going to get tried to do the same to Eminemhad DNA from on her from a period after her interaction with Kobe&#x200B;The dude said all of that and your only response was that he was slandering a rape victim, proving you can\\'t handle anybody possibly disagreeing with your view.[deleted]And yours is supposed to be helpful? Cancel everything you personally disagree with?*Edit: saw your post history. Didn\\'t know I was dealing with those with special needs. Go back to t_D.How about his daughter? Or her teammate, or teammates father, or the fucking pilot? Two 13 year old girls are dead.Personally, I hear Nickers or Nackers. no double g.I didn\\'t know they changed the spelling of the word apparently. It\\'s now spelt Nickers. Replaced those two Gs with ck. Someone should tell england they can\\'t use that word anymore.[deleted]Really brave guy does a drive-by comment on Reddit because he’s a low life loser and is unloved. Aww.No, rapists do not change overtime...just like cheaters and wife beaters.They actually settled out of court. Not justifying celebrating his death, though. That\\'s fucked up.So was OJYou’re defending a rapist. That’s trash. The DA was bringing the case to trial. The victim backed out after her family was paid off. Same as Roethlisburger. https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession> Huh? He admitted pretty quickly that he had an encounter with her. What the fuck are you talking about?it wasnt till he was informed that the cops had physical evidence did he admit to having sex with her> > There’s tons and tons of evidence he didn’t rape her. In what world is it safe to label someone a rapist despite evidence pointing the opposite?i find it hard to believe kobe on this issue when his first reaction was to lie about even having sex. sure he could have lied because he was married and he didnt want to it to get out. all i do know is that a 19 year old said kobe raped her and kobes first reaction was to deny even having sex with her.I did, and I had seen nothing until the article itself.I gotcha. I\\'m sorry I have you a hard timeI see you conveniently leave out how she boasted about the settlement she was going to get? Yeah, some dignity was lost for sure...Yep, that was her legit nickname. He always had it in any of her Basketball videos he posted.He literally said he wouldn\\'t. He/his family lost the very daughter who you claim didn\\'t have a shot of making it big--she was 13. Your comment is the most awful take I\\'ve seen on this event. Wear those downvotes with pride, I guess.e: Nice edit. You know exactly what I meant by status quo. Stop being disgusting.Yeah the same one with multiple DNA samples in their underwear who bragged about sleeping with multiple athletesIts like calling George Washington a child rapist, pretty low to attack a dead man.He wasn’t guilty. They found another mans pubes on the girls underwear. Not guiltyNo, it\\'s the fact that a man and his daughter have just died, and that the wife\\'s life is probably in shambles right now. It\\'s the fact that this man was way more than just an athlete to alot of people. And in any other circumstance I would get and allow comments like this. But doing it in a time of grieving, is just highly disrespectful and a dick move.You\\'re not edgy, you\\'re a dick.Well no it’s just that a daughter a son would be required to play in the NBA. I have nothing against women’s sports, but it’s unrealistic for someone competing in the WNBA to be able to carry on the legacy of Kobe, there just aren’t the viewers required to keep the name going as a household one in the sport.Yea I agree, a lot of girls don\\'t care for basketball and the ones that do mostly don\\'t play or just do it for fun. its a bit to much to call the reporter an ass for just asking a normal question. Its not like he is saying that his daughter couldn\\'t do it.https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/82de6s/because_of_the_recent_flooding_of_kobes_rape/[deleted]Theres a time and place to have your edgy neckbeard \"sportsball amirite\" argument...and in a discussion about a father and daughters death is not one of them.I mean once ESPN confirmed it after TMZ\\'s reporting it was a done deal, details like his daughter being on the heli as well were confirmed later, hence the \"basically confirmed\". Plus TMZ rarely gets a death wrong, so once they report it you should assume theyre rightFacts. I don’t feel like arguing anymoreRIP 24Well you thought wrong. Surprise surprise another uneducated trump supporter.[deleted]he lied about having sex with the lady until he was told they have physical evidence he did.i find it incredibility disingenuous that we have an entire thread dedicated to all the accomplishments this person did. but the moment him raping someone is brought up people get their panties in a bunch. you cant properly honor a person by only speaking of the good they did. yes he was one of the greatest basketball  players ever, yes he did a bunch of great stuff for the community and kids. but he also raped someone. all the good he ever did will forever be asterisked by that, and kobe is the one to blame for it.far from it. there is a massive difference between not talking to the cops and incriminating yourself by lying to the cops.“Do not talk” does NOT equal lie like crazy.lying to the police is a crime, which is literally the opposite of defending yourself. your argument is. Kobe placed himself in legal jeopardy by lying to police because he was defending himself for a crime he didnt commit. and he did talk, its not liek he said i plead the 5th or i want a lawyer. he talked to the police, lied to them and then admitted he lied. please explain how that is defending himself.The whole “imagine...” bullshit on Reddit is so played out. For not caring about the guys death you’re in here arguing with random people telling them they shouldn’t be sad. You look like the lonely loser in this situation just FYI.I just feel bad for your short-sighted view on life. Hope you get better someday.Hm then maybe you need new glasses? I mean, thinking his daughter is his son ö.öNone to my knowledge. Are you essentially arguing that the n-word has some type of cosmic power to it where it can never be invoked accidentally?Yeah fuck you too, I said don\\'t respond please shut the fuck upWell the law looked at the case and the law did not agree that he did. I was not there and neither were you.My God man, be safe and be strong. Please don\\'t drive until you\\'re well out of the shock phase. My heart goes out to you a million percent. Much love.I’m so sorry 💗[deleted][removed]I\\'m not seeing anyone named Christina on Kobe\\'s instagram pics...Weird that you would mention your sister but not your mom or dad that was also on the chopper...No one believes that shit. Now GTFO.Neither can I man. I went a little numb when I found out. Vanessas life just literally got flipped over, I know she’s probably got an amazing support system. But knowing she will never sleep with him again or see Gigi, it fucking sucks.> You can\\'t have a consensus by yourself...It\\'s entirely possible to be under the wrong impression though. Not everything in bed is proceeded by an ask. If I asked every time I went to choke my gf it would spoil the mood.This was definitely a situation in which a girl made stuff up. Many believe Trump is innocent. Many don\\'t mean jack shit.She wasn\\'t \\'excited to meet him\\'. She bragged to her friends about fucking Kobe Bryant. One of her friends she had plans to extort eminem in the same way. She was obsessed with celebrities and a hopsitalized schizophrenic four months before the encounter. When you\\'re considering sending a man to jail for life, I believe the credibility of the accuser is fair game.She wrote a letter stating that she lied to the detectives. Her whole story doesn\\'t add up. And she lied from the beginning, who knows what else she is lying about. [From Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant_sexual_assault_case)Link? He admitted to having sex with her, not raping her.You default to excuses; **excuses delay results.**Do what my mother recommended to me two years ago and apply for the Capitol One Platinum CC (very low scores accepted) and use it like a Debit card within your budget, paying for necessities, only once a month. Just enough that you can pay it off within that month. I just used it once every month or two for groceries and would nearly instantly pay it off using the app with my checking account funds. After 9 months of responsible use, my credit score jumped up 150 points and I could apply for the heavyweight CC\\'s with credit line thousands more than I even needed. Don\\'t use what appears like money with that credit line, cash is freedom, not credit and loans. Build slowly and focus on the longterm goals.Credit Scores are a dumb game we have to play but if you don\\'t care for your score, you won\\'t be able to lease the car, be approved for the mortgage or a reasonable premium on the car/health/life insurance, etc. Don\\'t leave your family to pay for your irresponsible habits, whether it\\'s spending or not having insurance plans in place. It may not seem fair but it is what it is.Keep moving forward.You gonna take the chance they aren’t? Do it for Kobe.[deleted]Yeah totally man keep thinking thathope you have that same energy with literally everyone who was never proven guilty and not just celebrities you likeIt depends how you view death IMO, if I don’t know someone personally I couldn’t give a shit If they live or die as edgy as it sounds, I think most people are like that but it’s not socially acceptable to admit it. I never said other people’s death don’t affect anyone, but it only affects people who knew them/knew of them. You don’t give a shit about a random hobo dying in your town, or a random Chinese dude dying from coronavirus, do you?You calling me clueless is like Kim Kardashian calling someone vain. Go ahead and tell yourself helicopters only fly in the mountains.  It\\'s on par with your belief that the earth is flat.No, \"most\" jobs with helicopters are commuting trips.  You\\'re just saying what\\'s truthy.They reported that all his kids were on board?Ok. I don’t have time to feed trolls.Back up what I’m saying?  I wasn’t the original person to post about him cheating and being an alleged rapist. I only responded to the dude. There is NOTHING wrong with remembering the great things someone did upon their death.  But with the great also comes the bad.  There are two sides to the coin.   Just like there are millions of women that love the guy, yet despised him when he cheated on his wife.  They fell in love with him again when he gave her a large rock to try to beg for forgiveness.   You can mourn someone, but you can also remember the shit things he did as well.  You have no right to tell anyone how to “feel” about this death or tell them to “react” the way YOU want them to react because it’s more comfortable to you.  I don’t see a damn thing wrong with holding a man accountable for his actions; regardless of what avenue it is presented (social media, media outlets, etc.).  Multiple news channels have also mentioned the sexual assault and the cheating.  You may not like that, and it may not sit well with you; but it’s a fact. I love Kurt Cobain’s music and message back in the day.  I mourned his loss.  He was a heroin addict and sought an easy way out. I loved Bill Cosby back in the day.  The on stage concert albums of his comedy shows were great:   He’s a rapist rotting in jail. Michael Jackson:  loved by many.  Yet things strongly show that he also played and loved many young boys.  During his death, these things were brought up as well. Just because YOU don’t want to talk about it, doesn’t mean this is not relevant news.  It is relevant.I think he’s jokingYou know wolf of Wall Street is based on a real life person and the character he portrayed was one of his best friends when he first got to Hollywood? Leo basically lived with that guy because he partied at his place and stayed over all the time. So your thoughts about it being drawn from personal experience are exactly what happened. He wasn’t just an actor for that movie. He was portraying a person that he actually was very close friends with and did live all those moments in real lifeI\\'d be pissed off too if the Academy that loves to give out Oscars for portrayals of mentally disabled characters, hadn\\'t given me one for the best such performance, in *What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape?*Did he scream “I’m the king of the world”? Bc that would be scary af — titanic wasn’t made until years later.Had a friend meet him at some industry party, and he was SUPER rude to my friend. Because he was quite drunk. I\\'m seeing a pattern.Yeah, I read that Leo was a jerk for a couple of years after Titanic fame. But I think he\\'s older and wiser now. Seems like a kind, humble human being.I like you as a person.That\\'s weird. I\\'ve heard leo actually doesn\\'t party that hard. Someone\\'s lying to meIf it’s any consolation I’ve been in a car accident where the car spun off the road and into the middle of the field. Looking back I always think how crazy it is that I felt no fear while the accident was actually happening - I only processed everything well after the car had stopped. I like to imagine a helicopter crash is similar.My heart goes out to you.[deleted]I’m black...you’re a cuntMmhmm, sounds like projection.Nice one man, it was a bit of a joke.  What I\\'m saying is heaps of people are talking trash about Kobe, getting downvoted and gold at the same time.  So New on the other one is getting bombed with this stuff.I gotta be mostly impartial, so negating Kobe from this equation on board the helicopter was a coach and the coach\\'s daughter along with Kobe\\'s daughter.  Mind you, there were no survivors.She said “nakers” by mistake when attempting to pronounce Lakers. You would’ve heard that if your head wasn’t so far up your ass.Of course having resources removes the possibilities of what you\\'ve mentioned. He still has a newborn that will never meet her father properly, maybe even remember him at all, other daughters that won\\'t be seeing daddy coming home again plus his wife just lost the reason in the first place why she\\'s in that position and her daughter, on top of that most likely her best friend and the love of her life. They were together since she was 17. Money can make easier a lot of things, but death is one of those great equalizers.You are an embarrassment.Today my husband\\'s childhood friend passed away from cancer. Today he learned that his mother may not live much  longer. A customer of his committed suicide. He wasn\\'t  particularly a basketball fan but the news has hit him hard because it gives him a focal point for his grief.  We are both in tears partly because our hearts are already broken, not only that, but knowing a mother lost her husband AND her daughter is horrifying.  Having empathy for others is not hypocritical. Our energy however is going to those close to us, but it is the icing on the cake for a shitty day.Please see a therapist>Reddit is all one person and they are a hypocriteThey literally had to sticky a comment saying not to make fun of his death on this post. Sort by controversial. The same people making the jokes you\\'re complaining about are making jokes here too. \"You people\"You\\'re embarrassing.Not everyone’s in poverty after the loss of a spouse?? Some people have savings, social security, life insurance. A lot of people actually, who aren’t millionaires.That\\'s not how this works. The burden of proof is on you. You\\'re making a claim that he raped multiple people and committed adultery multiple times. I asked for proof of these claims and right now you haven\\'t provided any. Not liking the guy because he\\'s committed adultery is fine. That\\'s a valid reason to not like someone. But you\\'re making an assumption that he\\'s done it several times.I was replying to your other account before you deleted \"trumpanzee\"I don’t know where you’re seeing these, because when you sort by controversial (which is the only way to find them) literally not a single one of them has any pro trump commentsI don’t think this is true (that it’s mostly Trump supporters), but I don’t think either of us want to take the time to go through every comment and count them so it’s probably a moot point.I agree with you that MAGAs are outraged more about the person than the act though.I mean theoretically yea. It would be dead silent. No sound of ac, the light “hmmmm” of the hydraulics running, or any bit of sound from the engine. But when a plane starts its decent, the throttle is typically set to idle, which is like the same thing when your car is idling. The engine is running, you can barely hear it running, but it is effectively the “0” setting for power as the thrust generated when the throttle is on idle will not be enough to accelerate the plane. During decent the throttle is idled simply because it wouldnt make sense to have it at a higher setting as the plane will be gaining speed as a result of its nose down attitude.I can agree but others remember him a different way.oh yeah thats definitely fakehttps://twitter.com/WPLGLocal10/status/1221531515961708544?s=20What\\'s the name of the pilot and 3 other people killed in the crash, you talk about simpathy towards victims yet you show none.There\\'s been plenty of cases where things get settled out of court rather than taking it to court. As far as the helicopter thing, it is kind of an asshole thing to do but it could of just been something cool for his daughter and whoever else was there. I won\\'t say that he wasn\\'t a bad person, but even bad people have done good things. We are all made up of good and bad things. We shouldn\\'t just be judged on one or the other. While he may not be great he did do some good things. His passing is sad is all I\\'m really saying.Yeah ok bud, he didn’t rape anyoneMan that sucksSo you’re one of those kids who are just disrespectful towards everyone’s deaths.Now TMZ who originally reported his death is saying 1 of his daughters was on board. There’s a mega thread on r/nba mentioning itYeah but there’s other reporting saying similar. Overall there are a lot of confusing/conflicting reports so I get your point. I think we’ll get some clarity soonWhite flag eh?Man I saw that one too. It seemed like it was disaster from the start. Horrible choice to choose to fly that day. I wonder what was going through that pilots mind since he was so experienced. We will never know.If it were a clear day or vision was not as obstructed, then there would have been a realization that they are in trouble. But with the fog and clouds and travel at that speed. The only thing that they\\'d be seeing out the windows is pure white. You\\'d be so disoriented that you wouldn\\'t even know if you\\'re upside down. This was the case when jfk jr\\'s plane crashed in the ocean. They were flying at night time and he wasn\\'t using his instruments and was flying visually. They couldn\\'t tell the difference on what was the sky or what was the ocean. Essentially barrel rolled right into the ocean.[deleted][deleted]It\\'s not if you didn\\'t know one of the most influential athletes of the past 20yrs. You\\'re just trolling at this point and it\\'s boring.Are you telling me you\\'ve never heard someone say \"KOBE\" as they throw a was of paper into the trashcan from across the room?And? The U.K. doesn\\'t speak for the whole world. There are more basketball fans worldwide than there are people in all of Europe.[deleted]what are you, eleven?So Kobe Bryant flying in a helicopter wasn\\'t a big deal two comments ago and now it\\'s a HUGE DEAL that Kobe Bryant flew in a helicopter? lolIs there a name for when people ping-pong between extreme opposing viewpoints with a straight face?It is an artful dodge, likely something a PR person wrote for him to say.Non-consensual sex is the definition of rape. You talk like someone who is afraid that this accusation would happen to you.He had sex with her, his story changed multiple times. He came in her against her will, she had bruising and vaginal lacerations typical of non consensual penetration in the last 24 hours.He then said he understood she thought it was non-consensual, and settled. After the adultery was already out in the open.Sounds pretty conclusive to me.Can you stop bringing race into this ? This is really unsetting. Not once have I ever mentionned the color of the girl, and the fact that you do makes me thing you have a dog in this fight.&#x200B; [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-harvey-weinstein-settlement/harvey-weinstein-reaches-tentative-25-million-settlement-with-accusers-ny-times-idUSKBN1YF2IB](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-harvey-weinstein-settlement/harvey-weinstein-reaches-tentative-25-million-settlement-with-accusers-ny-times-idUSKBN1YF2IB)No. It doesn\\'t. Expecially when it is an unproven accusation.Just because you want to beat someone down for an incident you can not prove.A person can do horrible things. And they can be forgiven. Love people, you won\\'t change them by branding them.I\\'m trying to bring some perspective to a conversation about a person as a whole. Kobe Bryant the person passed away, not just Kobe Bryant the entertainer/ athlete/ philanthropist. I\\'d encourage you specifically to think a little bit on empathy and what it means to say that someone sexually assaulted at 19 can take a step back to their rapist\\'s basketball legacy, as if sports can and should overshadow rape.Ahhhhh....Reddit. You two take care tomorrow.[Like this with everything on it?] (https://t1.rg.ltmcdn.com/pt/images/7/8/4/img_cachorro_quente_com_pure_2487_paso_2_600.jpg) 😁Ok, what else?I wouldn’t murder them, but they are shitty people who just make other’s lives more miserable because of status and because they want to then they are better off not being here. Cheating on a spouse is a very shitty thing to do in case you aren’t aware.To me or Penguin?You might be surprised to hear out of court settlement tends to help with reneging on testifying for a guilty verdict, Kobe was nothing more than a little wet slimebag snake anyone with half a brain knows thisNot required...common.  “and the fact that it\\'s frequently flown by two pilots, unlike most light helicopters.”Not engine stall. Aerodynamic stall. What’s your read of the ADSB data?   Why the sudden altitude  gain from 1200 to 2000 only to crash at 950?https://www.businessinsider.com/kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-sikorsky-s-76-2020-1[deleted]Yeah, that’s what I thought. You got nothing.I post Kobe’s own words, you post bullshit.White knighting a rapist. Shame on you.[removed]Riveting argument.Wow you are very uninformed. The fact that he cheated on his third wife and newborn son with a porn star is not the problem here.He directed the payments of two illegal finance campaign contributions. You can\\'t just pay someone $150,000 before a campaign to silence a damaging story about you.I didn’t equate them. I used them as an off-the-top-of-my-head example of lots of helicopter flights happening without newsworthy crashes.Why the fuck are you even still responding if you don’t actually know the information I’m querying?I’m not asking about private vs commercial, I’m asking about millionaires vs everyone. Death rate. You’re the one who’s equating millionaires with helicopter owners. I’m asking about millionaires specifically, not helicopter owners or GA.I compared General Aviation incidents.I didn\\'t compare tour operators which the previous poster mentioned.  They operate differently under FAA rules.I know that. I’m wanting to compare different things to see the difference. The other guy is trying to lump them all together and hand-wave away any potential difference. (The phrase is idiosyncratic.)Most likely, barring something unknown, the pilot flew it into terrain because he was flying VFR (using his visual cues to determine where he could fly) and not flying IFR (using his instruments to determine where to fly).  It is very easy to get disoriented if you are in the clouds with no visual reference.So people shouldn\\'t spam comments saying \"he\\'s a rapist\".That doesn\\'t make any sense. If you were embarrassed by me why would I need to be told i\\'ll be fine?Wouldn\\'t you, as the person embarrassed by someone need that? Or did you get another thing wrong?That’s not what he’s saying at all though. He’s simply pointing out the flying in helicopters is a higher risk activity than most. Which is quite simply a fact. Just because everything involves risk doesn’t mean we have to equate all things as equally risky and not point out more dangerous activities.there was an annual average of 1.44 fatalities (PDF) per 100,000 flying hours in nonmilitary helicopters. Over the same period, there were 13.2 traffic fatalities per 100,000 population in the United States annually. Since the average American spends around 780 hours per year (PDF) in the car, that means the fatality rate per 100,000 hours of driving time is just 0.017. Based on hours alone, helicopters are 85 times more dangerous than driving.Helicopters cover a lot more ground in an hour than a driver on the New Jersey Turnpike, so it might be better to come at the question from another angle. There are approximately 0.8 deaths on the interstate highway system for every 100 million miles traveled. There have been a fair number of studies on the average speed on the interstate system with varying results, but the average is probably somewhere around 68 miles per hour, give or take a few mph. That means it took drivers approximately 1.47 million hours to travel those 100 million miles, yielding a fatality rate of 0.054 per 100,000 hours in the car. By this measure, helicopter flying is just 27 times more dangerous than driving. You are wrong. Just because all things are dangerous doesn\\'t mean that somethings don\\'t carry more risk then others. In this case the \"risk\" is 30 times greater . Please stop posting nonsense or admit that If I go on that drive it\\'s 30 times safer then a quick chopper ride.Keep digging that hole, pal.You’re still putting the onus on me for commenting on that part of the article, which was *literally not political*. What part of politics was I discussing other than that the two men were both at one point the president? I didn’t even mention their presidential status, their political standings, their policies, or *anything of that nature*. It was a purely linguistic analysis of their choice of words.I’m amazed at the people who are personally harassing me for something that had absolutely nothing to do with politics other than that the two people in question are/were POTUS.Did you even read the article?Tweets from both are #IN THE FUCKING ARTICLEThat’s something you have to deal with being so widely known. Every celebrity and president has been and will be criticized for something. Obama was criticized for numerous things. One being fake birth certificate.  That’s how this world works unfortunatelyBecause you totally apologize to a teen after normal consensual sex.Everything you stated was leaked by kobe’s defense team to the media to discredit the woman. The prosecution never got to present their case because the girl refused to testify after being harassed and receiving deaths because her personal info was leaked by the media. It all moot because the man admitted in his statement that “he could understand why she didn’t think it was consensual”. By today standards that would be enough to end any public career the man had.It’s because it isn’t true. The facts are he choked and fucked the chick in the ass while his wife was pregnant. The only reason it didn’t go to court was douche bags like you threatened her life so she was afraid to testify. She won in civil court and Kobe admitted it on national tv.[deleted]Don’t bother with these people. They will white knight to the end no matter what you say. It’s really quite scary how some of these people areHow come their names aren\\'t in the title of this post?Try these true facts for a change:Eagle County Sheriff investigators first confronted Bryant with the sexual assault accusation on July 2.[1] During the July, 2003, interview with investigators, Bryant initially told investigators that he did not have sexual intercourse with his accuser, a 19-year-old woman who worked at the hotel where Bryant was staying. When the officers told Bryant that she had taken an exam that yielded physical evidence, such as semen, Bryant admitted to having sexual intercourse with her, but stated that the sex was consensual.[2] When asked about bruises on the accuser\\'s neck, Bryant admitted to \"strangling\" her during the encounter, stating that he held her \"from the back\" \"around her neck\", that strangling during sex was his \"thing\" and that he had a pattern of strangling a different sex partner (not his wife) during their recurring sexual encounters. When asked how hard he was holding onto her neck, Bryant stated, \"My hands are strong. I don\\'t know.\" Bryant stated that he assumed consent for sex because of the accuser\\'s body language.[removed]Cool, so people don\\'t change over time and we should define someone\\'s entire legacy based off of something they did when they were in their early 20s? Noted. When you die, I hope everyone remembers you for the bad aspects of your lifeNot celebrating his death, just thought I would mention all the victims. She is probably a mess today. And yes they settled out of court. She never wanted money, she had her own...she was just tired of being ripped apart in the press and he even said what happened was wrong. In his own words. So she settled.Yes, because a single Daily Beast article obviously should be enough to convict. Even though the crux of said article (accuser‘s blood) was specifically disputed by the sexual assault expert for the trial. To compare it Roethlisberger just shows that you have no ability to process nuance or that you’re acting in bad faith. The only thing similar is that they were both pro athletes. You’re trying to act like that makes the cases inherently the same, which you’re either doing in bad faith or because you have no ability to differentiate between things with top-level similarities.> it wasnt till he was informed that the cops had physical evidence did he admit to having sex with herSo like 10 minutes after they met Kobe. There’s a reason the accuser’s team never mentioned it. It’s basic human tendency > i find it hard to believe kobe on this issue when his first reaction was to lie about even having sex. sure he could have lied because he was married and he didnt want to it to get out. all i do know is that a 19 year old said kobe raped her and kobes first reaction was to deny even having sex with her........ If I was worth millions of dollars and had tons of sponsor money, and I didn’t rape that woman. That would be exactly my first reaction as well lol. The fact that THIS is held against Kobe is fucking stupid as hell imoIt’s all good! Thanks for being awesome.[removed]Male athletes are simply better in almost all sports. But I was excited to see her grow upSo she put on a pair of dirty underwear accidentally when she went to her exam - what has that to do with anything? Are you saying that sexually active women can\\'t be raped? Her blood was found on his shirt along with his semen.  Kobe admitted to everything but stopped just shy of saying \"I raped her\". She also never bragged about anything. Comments like this are the reason women don\\'t come forward when they\\'re raped.He was also a slaver who moved his slaves around to pretend he wasn’t a slaver. He is a disgusting sack of sick and the world would be better off if he never existed. I will attack him and the other slaver, scumbag, rapist “founding fathers” my whole life.\"The Kobe Bryant sexual assault case began in July 2003, when the news media reported that the sheriff\\'s office in Eagle, Colorado, had arrested professional basketball player Kobe Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee.\"There is a reasonable reason to believe Kobe Bryant raped someone. There is no shred of evidence that George Washington did.If he did, people would be bringing it up whenever Washington was praised. Death doesn\\'t absolve you, my dude.He admitted he was guilty...

Good luck dealing with thatIf it was that traumatizing for her, she would have testifiedInnocent until proven guiltyI’m not here to argue about whether he did or did not do that. Neither you nor I can say that for sure. What I am saying, is that he just passed away, and you can save this for another time. Have an ounce of respect for the dead.Well he was never charged. She was clearly lying.i hope you can further your ability to conduct arguments beyond personal insultsI mean, she was wearing a hoodie and was across the food court.[deleted]I mean, yeah.

I’ll post a follow up photo.I don’t think he made it up.There were nine people on board. This isn’t made up.If you read it again he said his sister coached the team.[deleted]I can\\'t fathom it.  It pains me and they aren\\'t even people in my life.>When you\\'re considering sending a man to jail for life, I believe the credibility of the accuser is fair game.Let’s me start where I agree. It 100% matters in regards to her credibility. However, credibility of information is also matters.>She bragged to her friends about fucking Kobe Bryant. One of her friends she had plans to extort eminem in the same way. This is tabloid gossip, which if you follow the other responses to me down, wasn’t reported by a single credible source. It was all tabloid gossip which to this day is more focused on selling magazines, and not giving accurate news. This was made possible because her name was leaked for similar purposes. Today, 3/4 of the stuff done during that case would not only be unethical on all journalistic fronts, but it would also be illegal. When you have an All-Star athlete, any fan or enemy of hers can now come forward with something that isn’t true to discredit her.If Kobe truly was “innocent”, why was the settlement estimated to be in the 7 figures? Settlements worth that much are usually when that person actually did commit the crime. If all the gossip people are running with was actually true, why settle for that much?>A few weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin, the accuser wrote a letter to state investigator Gerry Sandberg clarifying some details of her first interview by Colorado police. She wrote, \"I told Detective Winters that on that morning while leaving I had car troubles. That was not true. When I called in late to work that day that was the reason I gave my boss for being late. In all reality, I had simply overslept . . . I told Detective Winters that Mr. Bryant had made me stay in the room and wash my face. While I was held against my will in that room, I was not forced to wash my face. I did not wash my face. Instead, I stopped at the mirror by the elevator on that floor to clean my face up. I am extremely disappointed in myself and also very sorry to anyone misled by that mix-up of information. I said what I said because I felt that Detective Winters did not believe what had happened to me.\"Where in that “apology letter” did she say she wasn’t raped or that the sex was consensual? She seems to have stayed consistent about that.“I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year...  No money has been paid to this woman. She has agreed that this statement will not be used against me in the civil case... I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”He admitted that she did not at the time consent. That is rapeWeird no link yet...Trust me, much as I\\'d like to I have no current intent to end the suffering as it would simply give my mother a new way to get pity and act like she cared at allAll I can afford[deleted]Yes, [here\\'s the video](https://twitter.com/i/status/1221529073786195969)Wow, calm down. I\\'m not uncomfortable with people talking about his rape allegations or cheating. I could talk about that shit all day. On this thread, though? A stupid and unnecessary place to do it.  Nowhere did I say I could dictate how people react or feel about his death. I just have an *opinion* akin to there being a time and place. You also keep saying, \"holding him accountable\", to which I again say, comments in reddit threads are no meaningful way of doing that. Especially when the subject of the thread is his death. It\\'s like trying to take the stand at an award ceremony of his to bring up his rape allegations.My first thought was the office supply store and was like damn, that\\'s fucking fancy as shitIt was half and half. I knew Staples was a stationers, but I was guessing there was some kind of secondary meaning I didn\\'t know. Apparently they sponsor a sports place as well, and now I know.Do you have any source?  I have never heard that DiCaprio and Belfort were \"best friends\" or even ever met each other before DiCaprio started working on that movie.Wow. Did not know that.  He’s exceptional in that love and frankly everything he’s done for the last decade.No doubt about his acting chops.I think he is still a jerk just a 40 year old one not 22 year old. Different typeThat actually is a great consolation to consider. Thanks for sharing.All you managed to do in your reply was make it obvious that you are not well educated enough on the topics of sex, consent, sexual violence, the law, or human responses to trauma, to have a meaningful discussion about it.edit: and my gawd, based on your reply, your reading comprehension skills seem to need some serious work. Practice makes perfect. Maybe go read a book about sexual violence and consent, or the psychology of victims of sexual violence. Education is never a bad thing.I\\'m not a man.I never said it wasn\\'t sad, I said its weird that people feel worse when it happens to someone famous. That kind of emotional response seems disturbing and disingenuous. My original comment was basically saying at least his wife and remaining children will be well taken care off. If someone was the average person they\\'d get less empathy from people and end up struggling, far more then half of these middle class people who have made replies to me could ever imagine. People can recover from a husband wife dying, they frequently remarry. People never get over a loss of a child however. But most people haven\\'t mentioned the wife who\\'s going to suffer from child loss, that at least she doesn\\'t have to work and struggle on top of that loss like many people have too.😆 how native, it\\'s easier to believe it either way since we\\'ve already heard it done with Obama when he was in office.This isn’t a courtroom you blithering idiot. There is no burden of proof. You think he only did it once and just happened to get caught that one time he did it?  That’s fine.  You’re an idiot but that’s fine.  Also, [ask his wife](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/kobe-bryant-wife-vanessa-bryant-allegedly-caught-him-cheating-with-multiple-women-121811).That’s not me, asshole[deleted]You can say that for many people, still doesn\\'t make them a good person.thanks for proving my point. their names aren’t in the headline.Is it just a fun passtime of yours to bury your head in that sand?Well, he did and admitted to it soooooo...[deleted]I just saw that too.[deleted]Do you think it was cloudy all the way down those ~1000 feet they dropped?

It’s not that uncommon. And even if he did, you think one mistake is enough to merit him crashing into the side of a cliff and dying with his daughter? You’re acting as if we have something wrong with us defending him, while you sit there judging a man who’s done more for the world than you will even come close to. Everyone is bringing up one thing that happened years ago, but forget the millions and millions of people who’s lives he’s made better. That means nothing to you?Wow, you almost seem arrogant about this. Basketball is like only the 9th most popular sport in the world. Even table tennis is more popular. Your statement is outrageous and ignorant.https://www.topendsports.com/world/lists/popular-sport/fans.htmNope. I\\'m sure he is popular over there. But worldwide basketball is like right down in the lists. Even table tennis and field hockey are more popular and influential worldwide.https://www.topendsports.com/world/lists/popular-sport/fans.htmSorry to press the point.

Oh wait, we should \"believe all women\".times 3... I hope you\\'re a teenagerNo, because Kobe was known for flying so often, more than most people, in a helicopter he owned, makes the fact that there is a toy helicopter in his likeness, not a big deal. I don\\'t think this is a hard concept to grasp.Except he claims it was consensual. This is the point. You act as if miscommunication isn\\'t a thing.If you ask a married man if he cheated, his first answer is going to be no. That isn\\'t evidence of anything. Yes, bruising and vaginal lacerations are common in rape cases. But you know what they\\'re also common in? Consensual sex. Again, that in and of itself isn\\'t proof of anything.

The S-76 was designed as a VIP transport BUT was also designed for the oil industry.  The VIP world that can afford the S76 will mostly do 2 pilots, but can be done easily with one due to the oil industry wanting to use that seat for transport.   There is no reason to need another body in that seat.  > Aerodynamic stall.In a helicopter with a fully-articulated rotor ?  That is a fixed wing issue.  That wouldn\\'t be an issue here.  They were too low, too slow to think that they were anywhere need stall speeds.

And owning slaves is worse than raping people anyways.There is no reasonable reason to believe Kobe raped anyone, he was not convicted despite being investigated by objective neutral officers who found no evidence to take the case to trial.Why does everyone keep saying that?>Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I didGiven that the women’s game has fundamental disadvantages in terms of viewership that would be literally impossible to change, i don’t see how.[deleted][deleted]Again. Surprise surprise a trump supporter with recycled insults.[removed]When would be the appropriate time. This same argument has been used over and over since the story broke about him being accused of rape. It wasn’t a good time when it first broke and it seems years later it’s still not a good time.if you drive 35mph  in a zone thats rated for 30 mph, were you speeding even though you were never ticketed?There\\'s no argument to be had here. Somebody died and you\\'re an asshole. That\\'s all there is to it.The other day I tried to say \"judge served\" and instead I said \"judge jerved\"    I can assure you I have never once used \"jerved\" in any fashion prior to me saying it there.Yeah not like American rap doesn\\'t existHahaha well then I guess a monkey at a typewriter can eventually churn out Shakespeare, but never the n-word!Sorry for your loss Sean.Mate you don’t need to confirm anything - go grieve, go be with your family, most importantly just accept the next few months of emotions. DM me if you want to talk.The names of the other 2 were released. There was no Christina on the helicopter, and the coach was a man--definitely not OP\\'s sisterEdit: OP isn\\'t lying. God bless and may your sister rest in peace 🥺But the reports are that another player and parent were the others onboard and then the pilot. If it’s actually his sister then he lost a niece then too. I’m skeptical.“The poors?” Learn to spell, bitch.>This is tabloid gossip, which if you follow the other responses to me down, wasn’t reported by a single credible source. [Her friend was set to testify before the case was dropped](http://www.contactmusic.com/kobe-bryant/news/ex.pal-reveals-kobe.s-accuser-plotted-to-lure-eminem-into-bed)[People at the party told NBC news she was bragging about it](https://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-bragged-partygoer-happy-article-1.512242)>This was made possible because her name was leaked for similar purposes. Today, 3/4 of the stuff done during that case would not only be unethical on all journalistic fronts, but it would also be illegal. [The judge ruled that the name could be used in court. It wasn\\'t Kobe\\'s team that leaked her name, so it\\'s kind of irrelevant.](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/judge-dont-call-kobe-bryant-accuser-victim)>If Kobe truly was “innocent”, why was the settlement estimated to be in the 7 figures? Settlements worth that much are usually when that person actually did commit the crime. If all the gossip people are running with was actually true, why settle for that much?This is a pretty subjective argument. Many people would say that for someone as rich as him a few million would be worth not having to go though the trouble of being in court during the NBA season, losing salary and endorsements, etc.Yeah none of that is essential to the charge, those are all minor details. \"Cleaned my face\" vs \"washed my face\" and something from the morning, hours before and irrelevant to the event itselfI\\'m not familiar with the case, but this letter was after she went to the police and told them she was raped?I did not say she lied about the rape to the detectives. And neither did the other guy. Lied about details. Why not say the truth from the beginning? She also bragged about having sex with him to her friends at a house party a couple days later.None of which is admitting to rape.Stop lying.He never admitted this. That\\'s just flat out false. You\\'re a chump if you somehow came to believe that. Find a single quote of him saying that.No he didn’t. Reread his statement.“I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year...  No money has been paid to this woman. She has agreed that this statement will not be used against me in the civil case... I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”That’s not what I meant at all. Do life.Are they tasty at least ?are you offended because someone is saying maybe your favowite widdle cewebwity isn\\'t perfectYou just don’t get it.   Have a great day though.  You wanna argue semantics of “when it is tasteful” to do something.  You asked for a valid rebuttal.  You got it.  Your argument holds no water whatsoever.  I’ll move along now.  This conversation is obviously over at this pointMy wording was confusing but your tone is condescending. Belfort wasn’t the only inspiration for DiCaprio in that movie. The script was based around Belfort’s life but the tone in that movie also had a lot to do real life experiences DiCaprio had. Now I don’t even want to give you the name of the other person because of the “best friends” comment. Just ask for the source next timeDon\\'t believe something on a Reddit comment thread when they don\\'t provide any source, that is how false information spreads.[deleted]You’re digging for something that isn’t there. This isn’t political, by any means and you should not be turning it into that. A father, his young daughter, and 7 other people that were with them are dead. Many families just had their heart ripped out of their chest. Many fans and friends worldwide are heartbroken. There’s a time and a place, and this isn’t either of those. How you’ve conducted yourself on this thread is classless and disgusting. If you’re not ashamed of yourself, know that many others are ashamed of you.Calling me an idiot because I ask for proof? Just stop. It makes you look bad. With regards to the adultery and the link you provided, that\\'s great. That is proof substantiating your claim that he was a serial adulterer. What about proof that he was a serial rapist?Also, burden if proof isn\\'t exclusive to the courts. When you make a claim, you need proof to back it up.Dude I see plenty of left leaning people that are calling him out.Thanks for proving my point, you talk about wanting to see justice while you dont care for other people \"Maybe he was trying to rape the pilot\" your words, and I\\'m sure that others will see them.Then he would’ve gone to jail even without the victim testifying soooooooo.....It’s still respectful. If you have nothing good to say then shut your big fucking mouthYeah your original post was really classy.Being in cloud and thick fog with what had been described, they would have all been experiencing spatial disorientation. So they would have no concept on motion. Keep in mind they were also circling for a while. That all combined with the vibration and noise of a helicopter your entire sensory is all over the place. Its foreign your brain doesn\\'t know what to make of it.  They were probably likely on there electronic devices as they wouldn\\'t of been able to see nothing outside. I highly doubt that they saw the ground coming at them. Think of it like this, think of the most foggy condition that you have driven though at 60mph, and think of an object you just passed. You saw it split second. Now imagine that at 181 mph. They wouldn\\'t of known there fate in the last few second\\'s and they sure as hell didn\\'t feel a thing when it was over.[deleted]You\\'re seriously going on with this? The topic is the fame of a single player. Stick to that discussion instead of bringing up statistics that don\\'t disprove how popular one person is. An athlete\\'s popularity can and has transcended their sport all the time. Examples: Micheal Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods, David Beckham, Conner McGregor, Muhammad Ali.Whoever told you David Beckham isn\\'t well known in the U.S. lied to you. I don\\'t know what kind of point you\\'re trying to make, but if the gist of it is you don\\'t think Kobe\\'s death shocked the world, you\\'re wrong.Everyone knew who David Beckham was BEFORE he played in America. You\\'re insanely ignorant to what was considered general knowledge.[deleted]Funnily enough, it\\'s really not that hard to not rape someone.Unless you\\'re malicious or obtuse.Yes, I know them. Similar to the one I sent you before, bread is based on the French baguette. Next time I\\'m in Porto I\\'ll have one!Go on, what else?My brother put two and two together and stop developing off chance reasons for how he might not have committed the rape, there was NEVER going to be a conviction as a teenage fucking hotel worker is in no position to turn down settlement over pressing for conviction for moral reasons, where\\'s the headlines for the good people who have died today in this world over this absolute wank stain? Not many people I can say i\\'m glad theyre dead but this is one of them.Again, if you look at the track they suddenly gained altitude from 1200-2000 feet in 1-2 minutes lost speed and then fell down to earth to the crash site at 950’. What’s your theory then?[deleted]Yup, he didnt open it, and tells me \"I got nothing\"Kids these days...Did anything on that page refute Kobe’s own words in his statement?I’m not an expert but looked some info up and here’s my guess. Flying by using instruments is much more challenging and not all helicopter pilots are authorized to operate in such conditions (if you look up helicopter crashes you can see notes about the pilot not being “certified for instrument flight”). And in regard to Kobe’s helicopter flight, multiple news sources are reporting that the weather was so bad before and after the crash that LAPD had grounded all air support. The bottom line is it must be very challenging to operate a helicopter using only instruments. So I’d guess the helicopter pilot was either1) overconfident in using instruments2) unaware of the weather Either way it’s too badI have the same question[deleted]Because as far as we know he isn\\'t a rapist you mong, spreading misinformation for no reason is sad. If you had to describe Kobe Bryant to someone for the first time you wouldn\\'t straight up say \"he raped someone\" as your first description unless you\\'re an idiotOnce again, in English \"being embarrassed by\" means someone embarrassed you.The word you are looking for is \"for\", you weirdo.That isn\\'t data. that is just a sentence that says the opposite with nothing to support it. I just gave you numbers lol The reason I attacked your character is because the info I stated is so commonly known, but you had to follow your gut and try to correct me. I don\\'t have to think you are a good person, and based on that compulsion I don\\'t mind saying so.Like i said, You still deserve to be told to fuck off for being a passive agressive dick AND being wrong. Maybe if you were right you would have been in the clear. Sorry. Next time do some research before just spouting off what you want to be true - and you will make a better first impression. Problem solved.I’m of the opinion those people are small-minded if they can’t see past a simple name. If it were tweets from any other celebs nobody panics, except maybe diehard fans. The moment it’s a politician, everyone loses their minds. Like I’m being personally harassed and it’s not okay.C\\'mon now, show some respect here and use Trump\\'s proper title: IMPOTUS...Really? How do you know what I’m doing? Are you me? Are you that little voice in my head?[deleted]Take your meds weirdoOuch, I cut myself on that edge.Well he did just die in a helicopter crash so he is being remembered...You seem like a real nice fella.Upvoted your post of the sole fact this asshole is downvoting everyone that apparently disagrees with him because it\\'s the only defense he\\'s got.> Rape is the only crime that’s indefensible. God is judging him as we speak. Sad his daughter and others on board had to pay the price.Are you really saying that *God* killed him because of a decision he made when he was in his early 20s and blaming *him* for the deaths of the rest of the people on board? You\\'re a sick, sick person. I\\'m sure God will judge you when you die for saying that someone deserved to die. You Christians are really somethingBECAUSE HAVING AN AFFAIR AS A MARRIED MAN IS A BAD LOOK FOR MOST HUMAN BEINGS. Are you acting dense on purpose? WHY WHY WHY, do you think the accuser’s defense team basically never mentioned this if this was such a obvious evidence of rape?That was one of the most inane things I\\'ve ever read. Have a good night bud.That’s not true. Charges *were* filed and then dropped because the victim refused to testify in court on the basis of her own personal safety because she was getting death threats. They settled a civil suit out of court. He admitted that they had a sexual encounter that he thought was consensual, but he also admitted that she felt it wasn’t consensual. Being convicted doesn’t make you a rapist. Raping someone does.There is a reason they parodied that speech on the boys dude.Because the statement in its entirety is not the statement of an innocent person, especially when that innocent person is a millionaire sports player with the best attorney money can buy. Any rational person who reads his statement and understands the nuances of sexual assault cases will see this confession for exactly what it is.Look, no one\\'s saying that KB wasn\\'t an amazing generational talent or is trying to diminish his impact on his sport. It\\'s just completely unfair to society, especially victims of sexual violence, to wash over this dark chapter of his life now that he\\'s gone.Well considering she was Kobe motherfucking Bryant’s daughter and had A LOT of potential and skill already she *could’ve* changed that.[deleted]I didn\\'t insult you. I pity the fact that you feel the need to seethe about the President and those that support him on the internet so much. TDS is a hell of a drug.Hur dur fuck the law I guess. They had proof they had sex, not that he raped her.[deleted]Because that\\'s the same thing as being accused of rape. Fuck off.personal attacks aren\\'t an argument and aren\\'t necessary or conducive to anything productiveShe’s not a rapper, and she dropped a hard R. Fuck outta here.Lol ok, I disagree with your claim it’s just a flub, but this comment is pretty hilarious. Well done.Her husband announced it though. I don’t think her brother and husband would both make this up.I\\'m not saying I believe him 100%. But arent coaches for kids teams usually one of the parents of the players? I\\'m just saying your argument isnt solid.I said a credible source, and you gave me the website contractmusic.com. New York Daily news reports that NBC News was told about it, but if that’s the case why is NBC News not reporting it? The fact that there isn’t a story tells me it was either made up or retracted when determined to be false.I never said Kobe’s team leaked it, it was irresponsible tabloid publishing. Once again though, your source is smokinggun.com. No credible sources vouched for these accounts. I understand the argument behind making it go away, but usually those don’t approach 7 figures unless there’s some truth behind it. My whole argument isn’t that he 100% did it, just that there’s more circumstantial evidence there that he did do it rather than not doing it. For all I know he could’ve been innocent, but there’s not enough evidence where I can that that without a doubt he was.Didn’t Kobe lie as well? Denying having sex with her and then admitting that he did? Correct me if I’m wrong.Edit: he did in fact lie to the police initially about having sex with her. He knew who the police were talking about: read the interview with the police. https://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/extracts-of-kobe-bryants-interview-with-police-20040917-gdjra3.htmlTo be clear: I’m not saying that lying about having sex with her makes him guilty of rape. He might’ve lied because he was worried about word getting out of him cheating on his wife for all we know. My point is that if you’re willing to dismiss the accuser for lying, then you should also be dismissing the accused for lying.I looked at it as lies that try to paint her as more responsible. As you said, they didn’t have anything to do with the alleged rape.* Instead of oversleeping and looking irresponsible to her employer, having car problems looks like a problem less in her control.* Her wanting to clean up could be any number of things, such as not wanting guests or employees to see her like that. Even if a hotel manager saw her, the first thing they’d probably ask is why she was giving private tours. Once a police report is filed the hotel could reprimand herAs for going to the party, if that’s true I have no idea why she would do that. Only one site reported that story (New York Daily News). I always takes stories only reported by one source with a grain of salt, because you don’t know if those witnesses just had an axe to grind, or if she actually said that.Everything you\\'ve mentioned isn\\'t uncommon behavior amongst sexual assault victims. It\\'s one of the most mortifying crimes that can happen to you. Many victims try to rationalize it in their heads much like domestic violence victims do. Doesn\\'t mean that it didn\\'t happen.Apologizing for your behavior and saying why you understand the sex wasn’t consensual isn’t rape? You may need a dictionary.“I recognize note that she did not and does not view this encounter the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand that she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”I understand that she did not view this encounter the same way I did...she feels she did not consent (the past tense there meaning she didn’t at the time either)What more do you need to be convinced?? She did not consent at the time.Nice cherry picking. He prefaces his last sentence by saying \\'I truly this encounter between us was consensual\\'Right, amd I\\'m saying don\\'t worry, I\\'m gonna do life, even though I really don\\'t want to in the slightest, I\\'ll continue this miserable bullshitNot usually lol mostly pasta or rice, occasionally I buy a frozen pizza as a special thing if they\\'re on sale[deleted]They\\'re not semantics, it\\'s literally the core of this entire premise. My argument holds more water than yours but I\\'m glad you realize you have no more left to argue and we\\'ve come to an agreement. See you.What a pussy.Tone isnt in writing. It\\'s in reading. Get thicker skin pleaseWhat the actual fuck man, you cant comment stuff like that and not provide sources on something that just sounds made up, because a guy was ”condescending”.. jeesusLol, how was his tone condescending?He just asked you for source and stated that he hadnt heard that...We are right back to your poor reading comprehension. Go reread our interaction, as you have clearly misunderstood what I have been saying. >What is there to be educated about sex, consent, sexual violence and the law beyond using common sense?For you, obviously quite a lot. For one, the law does not care about kink. If your partner dies because you choked them during sex, most prosecutors are going to go after you (and rightly so). So yeah.... you are a fucking idiot if choking is not in writing (frankly a fucking idiot if you agree to choke your partner at all).>Sex is just sex. And it is only sex when all parties involved had given their consent.Right. Which is why what Kobe did was sexual assault. Sex is NOT an invitation for violence or strangulation. He strangled her from behind so hard that she had bruises. He admitted to doing that. What do you not understand about that?>Consent is consent. Only do things that he/she wants to do and do not do anything that he/she don\\'t want to.She did not consent to most of that act, and again (again!) the minute he strangled her without consent, he created a situation where most people would be too afraid to say or do anything. Most people would suddenly realize they had put themselves in a dangerous situation. You\\'re doing an awful lot of work to blame the victim. >Sexual violence is just violence involving sex and sexual activities. Don\\'t hurt other people even if they beg/ask you to do it.I agree. We are in agreement. Again, go reread what I wrote. >Laws are simple. Do not hurt other people even if they beg/ask you to do it.Laws are not simple, and upholding the law/executing the law can be extremely complicated. Which is why anyone is a fucking idiot of the highest degree if they do those things anyway AND don\\'t get it in writing. Also, what do you think porn companies do when they produce violent kink? They have both a contract, and video documentation of agreement. There is a lot of it out there now, whereas 20 years ago it was still very taboo. Now it\\'s on the front page of pornhub. So, clearly the law is not as simple as you understand it to be. >You are calling anyone a fucking idiot of the highest degree if they don\\'t get it into writing that a partner wants violence inflicted upon them. Yuuuuup>I think you are naïve and do not understand how law enforcement works. And you are moron to think that doing such things even with writings would be fine. You just don\\'t participate in any of kinks involving violence. And you do know that any contracts/agreements that were formed without lawyer are meaningless.Whole lot to dissect here.... To begin with, everything you are saying means you agree Kobe violently raped that woman. Secondly, I am very well versed in the State of Texas Penal Code as I spent 9 years working in a law office, for my criminal defense attorney father.... who also happens to be a very violent person. I would give my left arm to be naive about sex, violence, sexual violence, criminal code, kink, and how any of them relate. Try as I might, I cannot scrub my brain clean of my personal experiences or the knowing gained throughout. In Texas, you better have a contract if your partner dies of choking during sex. It is the only shot you have at manslaughter over murder. I was naïve when I was 17 and entered into a violent submissive relationship. That was well before kink acceptance, which is a big deal now. Further, contracts do not have to be executed by attorneys. That\\'s just not true - not here. You can write a will and date it and it is considered current, even if you have one filed with your attorney. AND, in Texas we still honor verbal contracts and have single party consent laws (for recording) to uphold verbal contracts. >The way you are thinking is quiet astonishing that you would even do anything that could even get you manslaughter charge. I would never  do anything involving violence even if anyone asks for it. I will stop immediately and leave and never look back as soon as the willing partner asks anything involving force/violence.I have only been the victim of sexual violence, so let\\'s be clear about that. I never asked for it, but I didn\\'t leave either. He kept me on a short leash, literally and figuratively: cut me off from friends, family, income, savings, mobility... all of which are considered domestic abuse by the US DOJ. (and all of which happens a lot to young women who grew up as victims of violence and had mothers who were victims of violence.)Kobe did the thing that you find to be astonishing and violent. Not me. Beyond which, your notions about what a rape victim does after a rape are baseless. We don\\'t know what those who never come forward do after being raped - no stats for that. We do know this woman was raped by Kobe. We do know she responded by having sex with 2 men before dealing with it. I can think of multiple reasons she would do that. (1)To try to reclaim her power. (2)To try to normalize the experience. (3)To create emotional distance between the act of sex and what she was feeling after being raped>How can we have a meaningful conversation when you are focused on putting me down and thinking that you\\'re very smart to even hold such an asinine thought that participating in dangerous activity that could kill sexual partner and possibly being charged with murder/manslaughter is fine as long as you have legally non-binding agreement. You think you\\'re very smart and an expert on this field when it is clear that you are neither.Again, you did a very bad job of reading. Your responses make that abundantly clear. Go back and reread what I wrote. >Have a good day.If you weren\\'t victim blaming, I would wish you the same.You and your rules are so fucking cringey that you are making my skin crawl.Have you ever interacted with a real person before?  Fuck it I don’t care.  Just go away, child we’re done here.  Go fellate the memory of your rapist basket ball player.  I genuinely don’t care.[deleted]i have no problem letting people know i don’t defend rapists or eulogize them.You still have to press charges dumbass, she dropped the charges before he admitted, literally just Google it and you will see.[deleted][deleted]Haha, if you’ve got nothing to say you didn’t have to respond at all man.How many Cricket players can you name without googling? and Cricket is like 10 times more popular worldwide. If Shahid Afridi died would you care?Shocked America and basketball fans sure.I have looked at your post history and it shows no amount of evidence will convince you. Have fun trying to defend a liar on reddit all day.Or don\\'t know how to say no clearly.[deleted]Good for your twit brother. I\\'d seek help for being glad someone died in such a horrific way with his young daughter. Your lack of empathy makes me happy I don\\'t know your shitty self in real life.[Look at the tracking data](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N72EX/history/20200126/1708Z/tracklog).They went from 12:44:35 PM  1200ft12:44:51 PM  1600ft12:45:07 PM  1950ft12:45:23 PM  2000ftThe rate went through the roof but the helicopter was slightly slower- meaning they were trying to trade altitude for speed - but they had increasing power.   It is hard to see when you don\\'t have a clear picture of the terrain.  Most likely, looking at the data, he tried to follow Ventura Highway.  The fog went so low that he lost it and turned into the mountains.  Realizing his mistake (losing the highway), he tried to correct and failed getting caught in those mountains while turning around.  According to the news reports - he hit at 1700ft> The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet. However, moments later – around 9:45 AM – they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 161 knots.[deleted]Nah. But I know yall traffic sucks.What part of \"innocent until proven guilty is only a legal principle\" did you not understand? There is no misinformation because whether or not anyone is lying about it is also unclear due to the currently present evidence. Misinformation would be lying about the evidence surrounding the rape circumstances itself, dumbass. Every rapist is an alleged rapist at first.Whatever you say my friend> That isn\\'t data. that is just a sentence that says the opposite with nothing to support it. I just gave you numbers lol I mean if you\\'re too lazy to click on the link that I supplied to read the article...Well you’re not wrong. Getting harassed is one thing, like you’re getting threatening DM’s? If so, I would delete your comment[removed]Yep haha, username checks out too.You seem like a real piece of shit!I never said that, you don’t know how to read. I’m saying he is dead now...so he is being judged. All of us are judged when we die.But lying to the cops is a crime. So your saying Kobe rather commit a crime then admit to cheating on his wife. Only for him to admit he cheated on his wife. None of that makes any ducking sense. The man was stupid rich at this point in his career with access to the finest defense lawyers money could by but chose to lie to police because he didn’t want to get caught cheating. ?She can claim she refused to testify for whatever reason but the prosecutor offered protection as did the police, she only wanted a payout.  Victims do not let rapist walk for a few death threats, and he got much more death threats than her.Yes, she thought it was not consensual, he believed it was.  There is no evidence he raped anyone, he was never convicted, a court never found him guilty, he never admitted to it, get over it.  He is innocent.He was never found guilty of sex assault, not civilly, no legally, not criminally.  You are slandering a good man who was never found by experts to be guilty of anything.How. Unless she was planning to introduce testosterone doping into the WNBA it would be impossible for her to overcome its innate disadvantage; that it will always be the slower and less physical league in a game that is most entertaining when played quickly and physically. I’m not saying she wasn’t talented, I’m sure she was.[deleted]You can keep using that recycled insult all you want but the fact remains that you’re disingenuous and you’re uneducated. A typical trump supporter. That’s why it’s so easy for y’all to be duped because you’re uneducated. For your information, I was replying to the original person who brought politics and kavanaugh into this thread. I’m not the one who brought it up. But you already knew this thus making you disingenuous.[deleted][deleted]im just using your logic. dont be upset that your logic doent check out. he was charged so he didnt do it, is the same logic as i didnt get a speeding ticket so i wasnt speeding. learn to form better argumentsGo back and read your comments. You\\'re a waste of everyone\\'s time. You aren\\'t worth an argument.Username checks outCan you link? I haven\\'t seen thatYes. Very plausible that it was a coach and daughter. But why come to reddit saying your sister was on board and not mention that your niece was as well.>I said a credible source, and you gave me the website contractmusic.com. New York Daily news reports that NBC News was told about it, but if that’s the case why is NBC News not reporting it? The fact that there isn’t a story tells me it was either made up or retracted when determined to be false.You ask for sources then when they\\'re provided you scream fake news. It\\'s like talking with a trump supporter. >I never said Kobe’s team leaked it, it was irresponsible tabloid publishing. Once again though, your source is smokinggun.com.That source provided the actual court documents. Did you read them?  >No credible sources vouched for these accounts. I understand the argument behind making it go away, but usually those don’t approach 7 figures unless there’s some truth behind it. This is your opinion. As an argument for his guilt it has nothing of substance. Unless you can prove that 7 figures = rape, which you can\\'t, i\\'ll just ignore it.>My whole argument isn’t that he 100% did it, just that there’s more circumstantial evidence there that he did do it rather than not doing it. For all I know he could’ve been innocent, but there’s not enough evidence where I can that that without a doubt he was.My argument isn\\'t that he\\'s innocent, it\\'s that the alleged victim reeks of bullshit. Kobe definitely committed adultery and in that regard he was a POS, but half of Americans cheat. I don\\'t know what evidence you\\'re considering that points to his guilt of being a rapist, but all the evidence points to his innocence. Literally the only thing the alleged victim had going was her account of what happened, which she got caught lying about numerous times.Yes, he didn\\'t know \"who\" was accusing him at the time. So yes. He denied it because he didn\\'t know who his accuser was. Kobe had extramarital sex with a lot of women, so his response makes sense.Except for the fact that those friends were called as witnesses and then the case was dropped....Her friend said she had plans to do the same extorting behavior with Eminem after Kobe.I see you left out the start of his statement. How convenient. “Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”He’s stating that, in his opinion, the sex was consensual but he see how she doesn’t view it that way. That doesn’t mean at the time she didn’t consent or that he admitted to raping her. Have you ever said to someone “I could see how you feel that way” even though you don’t agree with their perception of that event?Oh hi, last week. Sorry I quoted his words. Facts are hard.Life has ways of surprising us. I think you’ll come out alright.\"Please don\\'t rape, it\\'s not that hard\"is what someone could\\'ve said to him :(Not even close.  But have fun trying to think your argument is valid.   You pushing your feelings on others is NOT a valid argument that holds water.Asking you for evidence of your claims and explaining burden of proof makes me a child? You\\'re the one acting childish. Calling me names, insulting my intelligence, eg. You\\'re also using childish phrases like, \"so fucking cringey.\" So, before you start attacking people that are asking you to substantiate your claims, maybe you should ask yourself why you\\'re trying to push opinion as fact and to backup your claims.Yes, I interact with real people all the time. For someone that doesn\\'t genuinely care about this conversation or topic, you sure are spending a lot of time on it.But that wasn’t what your initial comment said, and I already agreed with you on the hypocrisyHe admitted to having sex with her but it was consensual, she later said it was rape. You could easily know she was lying because she was bragging about how she had sex with KobeYou clearly are a no life. Have fun saying whatever you want I guessJust ironic...'"
